In light of this, different policies have been implemented focused on cybersecurity, like the creation of specialized centers like the European Cybercrime Center or the {US} Threat Intelligence Integration Center. This chapter offers some analytics about the use that {ISIS} is giving to cyberspace, from recruitment purposes, to propaganda, financial support or even psycho-war.

Many related social and psychological theories have been put forward, however terrorism literature still lacks empirical research. In particular, little is known about the early processes and pathways to radicalization. Our aim is to investigate original research on pathways and processes associated with radicalization and extremism amongst people of Muslim heritage living in Western societies, that is, the group prioritized by counter-terrorism policy. Studies included in the review were original qualitative or quantitative primary research published in peer-reviewed journals, identified by searching research databases. All disciplines of journals were included. No single cause or pathway was implicated in radicalization and violent extremism. Individuals may demonstrate vulnerabilities that increase exposure to radicalization; however, the only common characteristic determined that terrorists are generally well-integrated, 'normal' individuals. Engagement in such activity is dependent on a wide range of interacting variables influenced by personal, localized and externalized factors. Further research should examine broader determinants of radicalization in susceptible populations. Future policy should follow this public health approach rather than constructing from perpetrators already committed to engaging in terrorism. © 2015 Institute of Psychiatry.},

Of the 5,182 studies generated from the searches, 11 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. We considered empirical studies with qualitative, quantitative, and mixed designs, but did not conduct meta-analysis due to the heterogeneous and at times incomparable nature of the data. The reviewed studies provide tentative evidence that exposure to radical violent online material is associated with extremist online and offline attitudes, as well as the risk of committing political violence among white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and radical Islamist groups. Active seekers of violent radical material also seem to be at higher risk of engaging in political violence as compared to passive seekers. The Internet's role thus seems to be one of decision-shaping, which, in association with offline factors, can be associated to decision-making. The methodological limitations of the reviewed studies are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research.},

	abstract = {Since Simmel's seminal essay on secret societies, little systematic work on the topic has been attempted even though the empirical basis for such work has greatly improved. The present paper uses six case studies with unusually good structural detail in analyzing one aspect of secret societies: Their organizational structure. In contrast with Simmel, I argue that secret societies under risk must be differentiated from others; that societies under risk have a wide range of structural forms; and that the major sources of structure are found in preexisting social structures rather than in psychological factors. Risk enforces recruitment along lines of trust, thus through preexisting networks of relationships, which set the limits of the secret society's structure. Structure can still vary considerably, depending primarily on the centralization of control of recruitment, in turn dependent on the control of key resources.

Nearly all text-based causal inferences depend on a latent representation of the text, but we show that estimating this latent representation from the data creates underacknowledged risks: we may introduce an identification problem or overfit. To address these risks, we introduce a split-sample workflow for making rigorous causal inferences with discovered measures as treatments or outcomes. We then apply it to estimate causal effects from an experiment on immigration attitudes and a study on bureaucratic responsiveness. Identification challenges in causal inference with documents can be addressed with sample splitting.},

	abstract = {A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining which topics that document addresses. We describe a generative model for documents, introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. \&amp; Jordan, M. I. (2003) J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from {PNAS} by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying “hot topics” by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.},

These models can capture word correlations in a collection of textual documents with a low-dimensional set of multinomial distribution, called “topics”. However, it is important but difficult to select the appropriate number of topics for a specific dataset. In this paper, we study the inherent connection between the best topic structure and the distances among topics in Latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA}), and propose a method of adaptively selecting the best {LDA} model based on density. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve performance matching the best of {LDA} without manually tuning the number of topics.},

To solve this problem, we created a set of techniques that utilize a semisupervised model that allows researchers to classify documents into predefined categories efficiently. We propose a dictionary making procedure to avoid inclusion of words that are likely to confuse the model and deteriorate the its classification performance classification accuracy using a new entropy-based diagnostic tool. In our experiments, we classify sentences of the United Nations General Assembly speeches into six predefined categories using the seeded Latent Dirichlet allocation and Newsmap, which were trained with a small “seed word dictionary” that we created following the procedure. The result shows that, while keyword dictionary can only classify 25\% of sentences, Newsmap can classify over 60\% of them accurately correctly and; its accuracy exceeds 70\% when contextual information is taken into consideration by kernel smoothing of topic likelihoods. We argue that once seed word dictionaries are created by the international relations community, semisupervised models would become more useful than unsupervised models for theory-driven text analysis.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.

We argue that the contemporary use of the term “extreme” fails to capture the different interpretations, beliefs, and attitudes defining extreme religious identity. To address this issue, we unpack the meaning of the term “extreme” in religious contexts and answer the call by scholars to provide a more comprehensive framework that incorporates the many different dimensions that constitute religion. We develop a model of religious extremism in theological, ritual, social, and political dimensions of religion based on the variety of Islamic groups in Indonesia. Going beyond an analysis that equates Muslim extremism with violence, we argue that Muslims (or indeed any religious group) may be extreme in some dimensions but moderate in others, e.g., extreme in ritual and moderate in political. Interpreting extremism relative to these four dimensions provides new insights when examining the global issue of religious extremism and helps to better predict how religious extremism is expressed. More generally, our framework helps to develop an understanding of radicalism that goes beyond a focus on violence.},

	abstract = {It is a strategic decision how people find their place in digital media platforms. Such decisions are navigated by structures of power and social constructions like culture, class, gender, media, technology, and individual maneuvers. {TikTok} has been a haven for everyday people in Turkey. This study analyzed how and why that is the case. Looking at the content on {TikTok} and critically engaging with discursive practices around {TikTok} and {TikTokers}, this chapter argues that “cringe” people, who do not share a specific taste and cultural capital, show their presence in {TikTok} due to technological affordances {TikTok} offers, the cultural climate in other platforms, and the carnivalesque which they experience on {TikTok}. It might look like they are only producing dance or dubbing videos, but they claim a cultural sphere. The mediation of this culture, however, is sometimes encouraging and empowering, and sometimes is toxic. © Peter Lang {GmbH} Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2021.},

	abstract = {Social media platforms such as {YouTube}, Facebook, Telegram, and so on have influenced pedagogical practices in improving student learning. However, there is limited literature on the use of the {TikTok} application in teaching and learning and whether this platform helps students or is only for entertainment. The {TikTok} application is one of the social media platforms for sharing short videos that are rapidly increasing in popularity. Therefore, this study reviewed recent literature on the effectiveness of using {TikTok} in teaching and learning from primary to higher education learning. Seven research articles were identified as relevant to this review through the predetermined criteria. The purpose, method, subjects and outcome of the studies were reviewed. It indicated that a complex subject like chemistry could attract the public to enjoy learning chemistry at home and improve undergraduate students learning. Other than that, learning skills like dance and sports through {TikTok} also positively impacts students. Language subjects like English as a Second Language utilise {TikTok} to enhance students' listening, writing and comprehension skills. Future educators in primary, secondary, and higher education may think about integrating {TikTok} into their teaching and learning strategies to stimulate the creation of original videos that adhere to instructional design principles. © {ICCE} 2022.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {{TikTok} has ousted Google as the world’s favorite online destination in 2021. As China’s first emergent social media app making its mark across the Global North and South, it has prompted a shift in our global mediascape. Following in the footsteps of {YouTube} and Instagram after it, {TikTok} is facilitating new identities through User-Generated Content ({UGC}) while challenging the hegemony of American-led platform culture. {UGC} analyzed in this article views it unabashedly as a youthful narcissism through which a form of self-reinvention online is created. This is culturally surmised as an intriguing new form of global creativity that I label ecumenical {UGC}. Yet, scholarship has largely examined {TikTok} through empirical and content analysis frameworks only, negating the compelling cultural studies issues evinced in this trendy media. In conjunction with discussions of {TikTok}’s meteoric rise, this article also probes how the Chinese company that owns this app bends several {UNESCO} media principles, creating its mediatic split with its twin, Douyin operating only in the {PRC}. By laying out this other path, one detects a shrinkage of cultural globalization in the pandemic era as {TikTok} becomes a carrier of ‘underglobalization’ flows, a disrupter and provider of algorithmic content, all going under not against older notions of global culture. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Social media users have long been aware of opaque content moderation systems and how they shape platform environments. On {TikTok}, creators increasingly utilize algospeak to circumvent unjust content restriction, meaning, they change or invent words to prevent {TikTok}’s content moderation algorithm from banning their video (e.g., “le\$bean” for “lesbian”). We interviewed 19 {TikTok} creators about their motivations and practices of using algospeak in relation to their experience with {TikTok}’s content moderation. Participants largely anticipated how {TikTok}’s algorithm would read their videos, and used algospeak to evade unjustified content moderation while simultaneously ensuring target audiences can still find their videos. We identify non-contextuality, randomness, inaccuracy, and bias against marginalized communities as major issues regarding freedom of expression, equality of subjects, and support for communities of interest. Using algospeak, we argue for a need to improve contextually informed content moderation to valorize marginalized and tabooed audiovisual content on social media. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Regarding news about jihadism, many researchers have observed that those who practice Islam are classified as a monolithic entity, and this entire religious group is generalized as a threat to modern societies. The main objective of our research is thus to know the discourses used on {TikTok} to respond to the binomial Islam = terrorism spread by mainstream media and the affordances of this platform used to challenge this miscon-ception. Using the snowball method, a multimodal analysis was conducted by identifying {TikTok} videos with the hashtags \#yihadista, \#yihad, and \#islamterrorismo (in its English and Spanish versions) to explore the uses of the {TikTok} platform. The resulting selection criteria included: (a) content related to mainstream media discourses on jihadism, (b) discussion of a topic related to Islam and terrorism, and (c) where the content creator declares him/herself to be a Muslim. In addi-tion, in‐depth interviews were conducted to provide an enhanced understanding of how the media promote the need to generate a counter‐narrative on {TikTok}. The results reveal that discourses from Muslims that combat Islam = terrorism discourses are constructed within the spiral of the dominant narrative, thus visualizing the negative discourses about Islam. © 2023 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: {TikTok} social media app has become one of the most popular forms of leisure and entertainment activities, but how hedonic consumption experiences (comprising fantasy, escapism, enjoyment, role projection, sensory, arousal and emotional involvement) of the {TikTok} app determine users' intention to use the app and its resulting impact on the actual usage behavior remains limited in the information systems literature, especially featuring the hedonic consumption perspective in entertainment industry. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs uses \& gratification theory to answer the “why” via predicting the role of hedonic consumption experiences that serve as gratifications to trigger technology acceptance behavior (especially, in form of users' behavioral intention to use the {TikTok} app and its further impact on usage behavior). This study utilizes the partial least squares-structural equation modeling approach to perform data analyses on 258 {TikTok} app users. Findings: Our results provide a strong support such that users' playful consumption experiences (i.e. escapism, role projection, arousal, sensory experience and enjoyment) positively influence their intention to use the {TikTok} app and its resultant effect on users' actual usage of the app. In contrast, fantasy and emotional involvement fail to influence users' intention to use the {TikTok} app. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, our investigation is one of the first studies to apply the hedonic consumption experiences as potential gratifications that derive users' intention and its subsequent influence on the actual usage of the {TikTok} app. Our study results would assist marketing and brand managers to redefine approaches and tactics to create effective strategies that implement essential determinants to increase behavioral intention among entertainment service providers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this study, we examine how Asian/American women creatively occupy the \#{StopAsianHate} hashtag on {TikTok} to counter anti-Asian racism and form pan-Asian solidarity. We analyze their participation in the \#{StopAsianHate} hashtag as anti-racist space-making practices, which we define as the act of carving out discursive spaces to spread counter-narratives to anti-Asian racism and claiming space through their agentive, visual presence. Drawing upon Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis ({CTDA}) as our method, we analyze 130 \#{StopAsianHate} {TikTok} videos by Asian/American women and examine how their anti-racist space-making practices draw upon the features and cultures of {TikTok}. We illustrate how Asian/American women extend the discussion on anti-Asian racism to include their gendered and raced experiences, and challenge racism in affective and evocative ways. We conclude by discussing how their space-making practices foster an ad hoc community for Asian/Americans across differences amid rising anti-Asian hate crimes. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Meanwhile, news publishers are embracing {TikTok} to reach a younger audience. We aim to examine the content strategy adopted by the most-followed news publishers on {TikTok} and how effective their {TikTok} strategy is in spurring audience engagement in terms of liking, commenting, and sharing. This study retrieved 101,292 {TikTok} news videos as of November 22, 2022. With the help of computer vision, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis, we found that {TikTok} news videos containing negative sentiment and more second-person view shots are associated with significantly higher audience engagement. In addition, this study demonstrated that the {TikTok} video features and engagement levels differ between the news publishers and other {TikTok} creators. Moderator analysis shows that both the effect of negative sentiment on engagement and the effect of the second-person view on engagement are moderated by the {TikTok} account type. The impact of negative sentiment and second-person view on engagement behaviors becomes smaller or even insignificant for news publisher {TikTok} videos.

Results are discussed in relation to Uses and Gratifications theory and {TikTok} was found to meet realism, coolness, agency-enhancement, community building, bandwagon, interactivity, browsing/variety seeking, and play/fun gratifications. In terms of failed gratifications for past-users and non-users, {TikTok} was perceived to be too juvenile/cringey and providing too much (cyberbullying) or not enough agency (privacy and censorship). © 2021 Western Social Science Association.},

To do so, a study was carried out on the content of publications on {TikTok} in four countries with different idiosyncrasies and national realities: Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and the United States. Interviews were also conducted with fact-checking agencies on the potential for misinformation and fact-checking potential on this social network. The results suggest that due to its characteristics as a fresh, visual network with easily shareable and viral content, {TikTok} is a network that facilitates the spread of disinformation, but which in turn is a tool for debunking hoaxes beyond the range of action of conventional media. © 2021.

	abstract = {Purpose: Although the short-video-based application {TikTok} and its {AI}-enhanced technology have achieved enormous success and reshaped the user experience, few studies have focused on the user experience in the {TikTok} context. This study adopts a technology affordance theory lens to identify the main mechanisms contributing to the user experience in the short-video platform context while including user experience level and video length as moderating effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 401 valid questionnaires from {TikTok} users and used the structural equation modeling approach to examine the proposed research model. Findings: Three technology affordances (perceived effortlessness, perceived recommendation accuracy, and perceived recommendation serendipity) contribute to {TikTok} users' optimal flow experience. Multi-group analysis results further indicate that individuals react differently to the same stimuli as their experience level increases. Finally, video length critically influences the impact of technology affordances on users' cognitive responses. Originality/value: As a burgeoning industry, the mechanisms enabling short-video platforms to engage users remain unclear to practitioners and researchers. Thus, this study's technology affordance lens provides necessary insights into how {TikTok}'s innovative and advanced technologies contribute to user flow experience from a context-dependent perspective. Furthermore, given that most existing studies have neglected possible variations in user preferences when investigating the effects of technology, this study enriches the existing literature by employing user experience level and video length as moderators. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Spanish-Moroccan mixed couples exemplify a case of cultural hybridization that reflects the colonial past between these two countries. In this context, social media is a space of opportunity and risk to face discrimination and othering. In this article, we draw upon postcolonial theory and Internet studies to consider {TikTok} affordances as tools that are relevant to understand how cultural, national, and religious identities are shaped and presented in digital spaces. In this sense, this study constitutes the first exploratory analysis of Moroccan-Spanish mixed couples’ (self)representations and identity construction as reflected by their {TikTok} content. The memetic and intersectional aspects of the mixed-couple identity emerge as central in the convergent nature of the platform and their lived experiences. Through an initial analysis of 8,653 {TikTok} videos, we identified 6 creator accounts with more than 10K followers to conduct a deeper multimodal content and discourse analysis of 146 videos. This enabled us to explore how these creators portray their hybrid identity through short, vertical videos harnessing {TikTok}’s vernaculars and affordances. The results enable us to propose the concept of performative hybridization, which involves discursive markers within these couples’ {TikTok} content that reflect a fluid integration of two cultures, while the pervading visual and narrative components reflect the dominance of one set of identity traits over the other. In this case, Moroccan culture is more prevalent. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Yet, while most of the scholarly attention has been focused on leading platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, the extremist immigration to other platforms like {TikTok} went unnoticed. {TikTok} is the fastest-growing application today, attracting a huge audience of 1.2 billion active users, mostly children and teenagers. This report is based on two studies, conducted in 2020 and 2021, applying a systematic content analysis of {TikTok} videos, comments, and even usernames. Data were collected twice, in two four-month periods, February–May 2020 and February–May 2021, to allow for comparisons of changes and trends over time. Our findings highlighted the alarming presence of extreme antisemitic messages in video clips, songs, comments, texts, pictures, and symbols presented in {TikTok}’s content. {TikTok}’s algorithm is even more disconcerting since it leads to a spiral of hate: it pushes users who unintentionally view disturbing content to view more. Considering {TikTok}’s young demographic, these findings are more than alarming; {TikTok} even fails to apply its own Terms of Service, which do not allow content “deliberately designed to provoke or antagonize people, or are intended to harass, harm, hurt, scare, distress, embarrass or upset people or include threats of physical violence”. © 2021 by the authors.},

However, what is meant by the ‘subject’ is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers’ subjectification on {TikTok} as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers’ short-form {TikTok} videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on {TikTok} as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of {TikTok} for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies. At the same time, it suggests that platforms’ transnational affordances in Global South contexts occur independently to Northcentric frameworks and interpretations. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {{TikTok}, a short-video app featuring video content typically between 15 and 60 s long, has become immensely popular around the world in the last few years. However, the worldwide popularity of {TikTok} requires the platform to constantly negotiate with the rules, norms and regulatory frameworks of the regions where it operates. Failure to do so has had significant consequences. For example, for content-related reasons, the platform has been (temporarily and permanently) banned in several countries, including India, Indonesia and Pakistan. Moreover, its Chinese ownership and popularity among underage users have made the platform subject to heightened scrutiny and criticism. In this paper, we introduce the notion of visibility moderation, defined as the process through which digital platforms manipulate the reach of user-generated content through algorithmic or regulatory means. We discuss particular measures {TikTok} implements to shape visibility and issues arising from it. This paper presents findings from interviews with content creators, which takes a user-centric approach to understand their sense-making of and negotiation with {TikTok}'s visibility moderation. Findings from this study also highlight concerns that leave these stakeholders feeling confused, frustrated or powerless, which offer important directions for further research. © 2022 The Authors.

Informed by Uses and Gratifications Theory, the present study investigates the flow states experienced when using each social media platform and whether these flow states differentially impact user well-being. A flow state is achieved when people are so engrossed in an activity that little else seems to matter to them and they will often continue the activity despite its negative consequences. Based upon a survey of adult Instagram (n = 195, Mage = 38) and {TikTok} users (n = 225, Mage = 37), the present study identified four unique clusters of users for both platforms based upon the levels of five flow dimensions: focused attention, curiosity, enjoyment, telepresence, and time distortion. Results found that {TikTok} users reported higher levels of overall flow than Instagram users. {TikTok} users also reported higher levels of the flow dimensions "enjoyment"and "time distortion."The flow dimension of "telepresence"(immersion in a world created by the social media application) for both {TikTok} and Instagram users was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. These social media may provide an escape from everyday worries for users, although a suboptimal coping strategy. Whether Instagram and {TikTok} use are but "improved means to an unimproved end"is an important question that requires additional research.  © 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

This study focused on the personality traits and narcissistic behavior of university students about whether they use {TikTok} or make a short-form video for getting attention to have self-esteem, need to belong, or need for admiration and how much time they spent on these social sites. The study focused to examine {TikTok} addiction by surveying 350 university students through a purposive sampling technique. The study found that a positive correlation exists between independent, dependent, and mediating variables. In addition to this, the results showed that only grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism have a direct effect on the {TikTok} addiction. On the other hand, the need for admiration has also a direct effect on {TikTok} addiction. For the specific indirect effect, neuroticism, which is a personality trait, has no indirect effect on the addition of {TikTok} through the mediators like need to belong, need for admiration, and self-esteem. This study highlights the contribution towards the media-related research that can be identified by the general public. Hence policymakers can make strategies for social media users to overcome addictive tendencies. Copyright © 2022 by Cherkas Global University.},

Within this context, this introduction to the Special Issue titled “{TikTok} and Social Movements” begins by thinking about how social media pop cultures have served as a vehicle for mobilizing and engaging in social movements for social (in)justice and politics in the era of social media. By situating {TikTok}, a nascent platform and culture of short video, within the ongoing discussion of digitally mobilized movements and social justice, this introduction addresses several crucial points to consider when discussing {TikTok} cultures and social movements that are happening or interrupted on the platform. These points are interrogated with more details and cultural contexts in the five case studies and three expert commentaries in this Special Issue. Specifically, the collection of papers interrogate how {TikTok}’s interactive and creative affordances have augmented and altered our cultures, practices, politics, and power dynamics of engaging with publics for various beliefs and social agendas. © The Author(s) 2023.},

While its popularity is undeniable, at the first glance, it seems to offer features already available on previously existing and well-established platforms such as Instagram, {YouTube}, and Facebook. To understand processes of self-making on {TikTok}, we undertake two methods of data collection: a walkthrough of the app and its surrounding environment, and 14 semistructured participant interviews. A qualitative analysis of this data finds three distinct themes emerge: (1) awareness of the algorithm, (2) content without context, and (3) self-creation across platforms. These results show that {TikTok} departs from existing platforms in the model of self-making it engenders, which we term “the algorithmized self”—a complication of the pre-existing “networked self” framework. © The Author(s) 2022.},

This chapter offers an analysis of how the World Wide Web and digital technologies influence gender identity politics in contemporary Russian society. We look at the ways Russians construct gender online, how their practices become means of resistance and activism, and how they adapt and shape digital technologies to perform their gender identities and communicate with the State in the situation of increasing surveillance and control of material and cyberspaces.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, marked by the supposedly universal access to different types of social media, we have seen the emergence of forms of popular feminism embedded in complex dynamics. Often cohabiting in these dynamics are ambivalent ideas and imaginaries that both reject and express feminist issues. Particularly during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, the use of digital technologies increased exponentially to overcome mobility constraints, popularizing connective action around feminism and, at the same time, reinforcing normative views of society. This article explores these ambivalences by focusing on {TikTok} discourses, whose popularity grew intensely during the pandemic. Departing from a feminist constructionist perspective and using content analysis, we examine the 100 most prominent videos on the Portuguese hashtags \#feminismo (\#feminism) and \#antifeminismo (\#antifeminism) in the period corresponding to general containment measures in the second phase of the public health crisis. The results are less than encouraging. Over half of the analysed videos contain discursive dynamics conforming to social hierarchization (53\%), often reaffirming gender stereotypes. By allowing forms of popular feminism and antifeminism to permeate the shared discourses, the results suggest that the platform gives rise to ideas and discourses that reify unbalanced power relations.},

However, despite its ability to share brands’ viral content, scant research has examined {TikTok} as an advertising vehicle and its implications for viral advertising campaigns. Drawing on the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the concept of self-relevance, the present study explores the impact of perceived personalization of {TikTok} content on perceived creativity, authenticity, and viral behavioral intentions. The relationships between perceived creativity and authenticity and between viral behavioral intentions and purchase intentions are also examined. The results show that the personalization of {TikTok} content is positively related to perceived creativity and authenticity, which consequently lead to viral behavior intention on {TikTok}. In addition, perceived creativity of {TikTok} content is positively related to authenticity. The findings also suggest that need for uniqueness moderates the relationship between personalization and viral behavioral intentions. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into the roles of perceived creativity, authenticity, and need for uniqueness in the impact of {TikTok}’s personalized content on viral behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications for advertisers are discussed.},

In total, N = 762 posts were manually analyzed. The study shows that female politicians receive more likes when they are visible in a picture compared to male politicians. It also reveals that male and female politicians both refer more to feminine issues than to masculine issues, although the use of feminine issues resulted in less likes. We find that some issues lead to more discussion amongst Instagram users, and that this differs between male and female politicians.

In recent years, however, these debates have gained renewed momentum. Rapid technological change and increased use of digital media have raised questions about how digital technologies change, influence, and shape feminist politics. This book interrogates the digital interface of transnational protest movements and local activism in feminist politics. Examining how global feminist politics is articulated at the nexus of the transnational/national, we take contemporary German protest culture as a case study for the manner in which transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work. The book explores how movements and actions from outside Germany's borders circulate digitally and resonate differently in new local contexts, and further, how these border-crossings transform grass-roots activism as it goes digital. This book was originally published as a special issue of Feminist Media Studies.},

As China’s first emergent social media app making its mark across the Global North and South, it has prompted a shift in our global mediascape. Following in the footsteps of {YouTube} and Instagram after it, {TikTok} is facilitating new identities through User-Generated Content ({UGC}) while challenging the hegemony of American-led platform culture. {UGC} analyzed in this article views it unabashedly as a youthful narcissism through which a form of self-reinvention online is created. This is culturally surmised as an intriguing new form of global creativity that I label ecumenical {UGC}. Yet, scholarship has largely examined {TikTok} through empirical and content analysis frameworks only, negating the compelling cultural studies issues evinced in this trendy media. In conjunction with discussions of {TikTok}’s meteoric rise, this article also probes how the Chinese company that owns this app bends several {UNESCO} media principles, creating its mediatic split with its twin, Douyin operating only in the {PRC}. By laying out this other path, one detects a shrinkage of cultural globalization in the pandemic era as {TikTok} becomes a carrier of ‘underglobalization’ flows, a disrupter and provider of algorithmic content, all going under not against older notions of global culture. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Purpose: {TikTok}, a social media application (app), was originally positioned as a short music video community suitable for young users, and the app is user-generated content ({UGC}) short video of vertical music. Users can make their own creative videos. Following the rhythm of the music, users can shoot various video content, personal talents, life records, performances, dances, plot interpretations, etc. However, what are the profiles and preferences of {TikTok} users, whereby the social media app is mainly developed by {UGC}? What is the impact of {TikTok} on the development of social media? In addition, what is {UGC}'s social media model for user interactions in social networks? The purpose of this paper is to address and study these proposed issues. Design/methodology/approach: All questionnaire items are designed as nominal and ordinal scales (not Likert scale). The obtained data from questionnaires are put into the relational database (N = 2,011). This empirical study takes Taiwan {TikTok} users as the research object, implements data mining analytics to generate user profiles through clustering analysis and further uses association rules’ analysis to analyze social media apps in social network interaction and social apps’ development by proposing two patterns and several meaningful rules. Findings: This study finds that social media apps is a valuable practical research topic on online social media development. In addition, besides the {TikTok}, the authors eagerly await subsequent research to provide more valuable findings of social media apps in both theory and practice. Originality/value: This study presents the research evidences that social media apps such as {TikTok} will be able to transcend the current development pattern of social media and make good use of the media and technology innovation of apps in social development and social informatics. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Instead of focusing on app features and uses within the platform proper, we situate and critically analyse {TikTok} as a platform business in a global media policy and governance context. We first unpack {TikTok}’s platformization process, tracing how {TikTok} gradually diversifies its business models and platform affordances to serve multisided markets. To understand {TikTok}’s platform governance, we systematically analyse and compare its data and content policies for different regions. Crucial to its global expansion, we then look at {TikTok}’s lobbying efforts to maintain government relations and corporate responses after facing multiple regulatory probing by various national governments. {TikTok}’s case epitomizes problems and challenges faced by a slew of globalizing Chinese digital platforms in increasingly contested geopolitics that cut across the chasms and fault lines between the rise of China and India as emergent powers in the {US}-dominated global platform ecosystem. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

	abstract = {Subjectification has been defined as the formation of the subject via discourses while social media bundles audio-visual discourses that afford subjectification. However, what is meant by the ‘subject’ is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers’ subjectification on {TikTok} as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers’ short-form {TikTok} videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on {TikTok} as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of {TikTok} for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies. At the same time, it suggests that platforms’ transnational affordances in Global South contexts occur independently to Northcentric frameworks and interpretations. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Despite their growing popularity, little research has focused on the association between Instagram and {TikTok} use and psychological well-being. Informed by Uses and Gratifications Theory, the present study investigates the flow states experienced when using each social media platform and whether these flow states differentially impact user well-being. A flow state is achieved when people are so engrossed in an activity that little else seems to matter to them and they will often continue the activity despite its negative consequences. Based upon a survey of adult Instagram (n = 195, Mage = 38) and {TikTok} users (n = 225, Mage = 37), the present study identified four unique clusters of users for both platforms based upon the levels of five flow dimensions: focused attention, curiosity, enjoyment, telepresence, and time distortion. Results found that {TikTok} users reported higher levels of overall flow than Instagram users. {TikTok} users also reported higher levels of the flow dimensions "enjoyment"and "time distortion."The flow dimension of "telepresence"(immersion in a world created by the social media application) for both {TikTok} and Instagram users was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. These social media may provide an escape from everyday worries for users, although a suboptimal coping strategy. Whether Instagram and {TikTok} use are but "improved means to an unimproved end"is an important question that requires additional research.  © 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

This study focused on the personality traits and narcissistic behavior of university students about whether they use {TikTok} or make a short-form video for getting attention to have self-esteem, need to belong, or need for admiration and how much time they spent on these social sites. The study focused to examine {TikTok} addiction by surveying 350 university students through a purposive sampling technique. The study found that a positive correlation exists between independent, dependent, and mediating variables. In addition to this, the results showed that only grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism have a direct effect on the {TikTok} addiction. On the other hand, the need for admiration has also a direct effect on {TikTok} addiction. For the specific indirect effect, neuroticism, which is a personality trait, has no indirect effect on the addition of {TikTok} through the mediators like need to belong, need for admiration, and self-esteem. This study highlights the contribution towards the media-related research that can be identified by the general public. Hence policymakers can make strategies for social media users to overcome addictive tendencies. Copyright © 2022 by Cherkas Global University.},

Second, we urge researchers to move away from simplistic measures of social media and to utilize mixed-methods approaches. Third, we advocate for the development of new theories that can be tested longitudinally and that capture the unique influences of social media, rather than relying solely on existing models that were developed for traditional media. Fourth, we provide recommendations regarding practical strategies, such as the inclusion of media literacy campaigns, increased research on the role of reality check disclaimers, and further examination regarding the role of body positivity in prevention and intervention efforts. Finally, we end with recommendations regarding advocacy, such as using social media to harness positive efforts and partnering with social media companies regarding their use of algorithms.},

	abstract = {During the {COVID}-19 pandemic, health-related misinformation and harmful content shared online had a significant adverse effect on society.In an attempt to mitigate this adverse effect, mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and {TikTok} employed soft moderation interventions (i.e., warning labels) on potentially harmful posts.Such interventions aim to inform users about the post's content without removing it, hence easing the public's concerns about censorship and freedom of speech.Despite the recent popularity of these moderation interventions, as a research community, we lack empirical analyses aiming to uncover how these warning labels are used in the wild, particularly during challenging times like the {COVID}-19 pandemic.In this work, we analyze the use of warning labels on {TikTok}, focusing on {COVID}-19 videos.First, we construct a set of 26 {COVID}-19 related hashtags, and then we collect 41K videos that include those hashtags in their description.Second, we perform a quantitative analysis on the entire dataset to understand the use of warning labels on {TikTok}.Then, we perform an in-depth qualitative study, using thematic analysis, on 222 {COVID}-19 related videos to assess the content and the connection between the content and the warning labels.Our analysis shows that {TikTok} broadly applies warning labels on {TikTok} videos, likely based on hashtags included in the description (e.g., 99\% of the videos that contain \#coronavirus have warning labels).More worrying is the addition of {COVID}-19 warning labels on videos where their actual content is not related to {COVID}-19 (23\% of the cases in a sample of 143 English videos that are not related to {COVID}-19).Finally, our qualitative analysis on a sample of 222 videos shows that 7.7\% of the videos share misinformation/harmful content and do not include warning labels, 37.3\% share benign information and include warning labels, and that 35\% of the videos that share misinformation/harmful content (and need a warning label) are made for fun. Our study demonstrates the need to develop more accurate and precise soft moderation systems, especially on a platform like {TikTok} that is extremely popular among people of younger age.},

To describe the availability and content of sexual education on {TikTok}, we conducted a content analysis of themes for 100 sex education?focused videos. We found that female anatomy was the most frequently addressed topic. Sexual pleasure was the second most common theme, within which discussions of the female orgasm and arousal constituted the most common subtheme. Other common themes include contraception and sexual health. These sought-after topics may be incongruent with those presented in standard school- or home-based sex education or interactions with health care providers, and this disconnect suggests opportunities for health care providers and educators to initiate conversations or offer resources on these themes as part of routine interaction. We conclude with recommendations for future research to consider the factual accuracy of sex education on {TikTok} and determine how exposure to this content affects adolescents? understanding of the risks and benefits of intercourse, sexual practices, age- and gender-based sexual norms, and other health behaviors.},

The gender-biased religious lectures delivered in social media by some famous figures perpetuate the discrimination against women in Indonesia. This research answers how and why the religious lectures with gender-biased theme appear massively on social media. By using a qualitative method and feminist approach, the study focuses on the religious preachers on the new social media. This study shows that the large amounts of lectures with the gender-biased theme in social media are inseparable from the role of the promotional accounts. It shares videos of gender-themed propaganda massively and attractively to attract many visitors and followers of these accounts. This study reveals that the massive religious lectures with gender bias on social media are not only dealing with the textual understanding of religious texts but also a matter of the religious commodification. The actors of business could determine the massively particular religious discourse on social media. © 2020 {STAIN} Kudus. All rights reserved.},

The present study explores cultural identity patterns and the sociodemographic and family contexts of 150 Arab Muslim American young adults ages 18-25 who completed an Internet study. The participants fell into three cultural identity groups: High Bicultural, Moderate Bicultural, and High Arab Cultural. Although all three groups demonstrated positive general family functioning, the Moderate Bicultural group was distinct in that they were less likely to be engaged or married, and they experienced less family support and more family acculturative stressors. The results highlight the importance of the family context in contributing to a stronger sense of cultural identity for young adults who fall at the intersection of Arab and American culture and Muslim faith.},

First, it analyses how various genres of European and American video games have constructed the Arab or Muslim Other. Within these games, it demonstrates how the diverse ethnic and religious identities of the Islamic world have been flattened out and reconstructed into a series of social typologies operating within a broader framework of terrorism and hostility. It then contrasts these broader trends in western digital representation with selected video games produced in the Arab world, whose authors have knowingly subverted and refashioned these stereotypes in two unique and quite different fashions. In conclusion, it considers the significance of western attempts to transcend simplified patterns of representation that have dominated the video game industry by offering what are known as 'serious' games.

We analyzed more than 10,000 social media posts on Weibo relating to Muslims and Islam and conducted in-depth interviews with 34 Chinese Muslims who were active users of social media. Our findings reveal an anti-Muslim online frame, and we detail the ways in which Chinese Muslims have sought to influence public policy in order to protect their rights. The participants in this study responded to hateful posts and worked to increase the understanding of their religion and culture by providing glimpses of their daily lives and by discussing Islam.

The themes that emerged were: (1) Islam as a liberal religion; (2) Islam as a religion of extremism and terrorism; (3) Islam as religion of gender discrimination; (4) Islam as a religion of collective identity; and (5) Islam as a humane religion.

	abstract = {Using expert interviews and focus groups, this book investigates the theoretical and practical intersection of misinformation and social media hate in contemporary societies. Social Media and Hate argues that these phenomena, and the extreme violence and discrimination they initiate against targeted groups, are connected to the socio-political contexts, values and behaviours of users of social media platforms such as Facebook, {TikTok}, {ShareChat}, Instagram and {WhatsApp}. The argument moves from a theoretical discussion of the practices and consequences of sectarian hatred, through a methodological evaluation of quantitative and qualitative studies on this topic, to four qualitative case studies of social media hate, and its effects on groups, individuals and wider politics in India, Brazil, Myanmar and the {UK}. The technical, ideological and networked similarities and connections between social media hate against people of African and Asian descent, indigenous communities, Muslims, Dalits, dissenters, feminists, {LGBTQIA} communities, Rohingya and immigrants across the four contexts is highlighted, stressing the need for an equally systematic political response.

The primary attention in this stimulation investigation drives the impulsive buying between the Generation Z of Muslim women customers in Indonesia. This study provides valuable concept to help a company or cosmetic brand grow the marketing strategy for stimulating impulsive behaviour of Generation Z customers on {TikTok} Shop. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey of 256 Muslim women consumers of the Generation Z was used to collect the data. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied to assess the five hypotheses. Findings: The results of this study indicate that micro-celebrities post authenticity has a positive and significant relationship with utilitarian browsing. However, micro-celebrities post authenticity did not have a positive and significant relationship with hedonic browsing. This study also concludes that utilitarian browsing was found to have a positive and significant relationship with hedonic browsing. Finally, hedonic browsing was found to have a positive and significant effect on reminiscence impulse purchase intention and designed impulse purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The primary limitation is the research sample that only consists of Indonesian {TikTok} Shop customers. Next, the researchers could examine the research model in several countries to expand its generalisation. The second one, this research does not consider the origin country of a cosmetic product. The future study must investigate the local and foreign cosmetics to see the preference and the differences in the impulsive purchase, especially for Z women generation customer. Third, this study quantifies the intention to buy impulsively so that the following research must investigate the ownership of the cosmetics product that has been bought before. Finally, the research only involves a quantitative research method. The future study must investigate with another approach, such as a qualitative method or mixed-method, in the impulsive purchase intention context. Practical implications: A cosmetic company or marketer could maximise the authenticity, relevancy and attractive information that is posted by micro media social celebrities or media social influencers. Cosmetic companies or marketers must provide comprehensive information to satisfy customers’ browsing actions. Finally, besides the information related to the limited cosmetics product stock, discount and promotion as the effective strategy to stimulate the impulsive buying, the cosmetics marketing can use gamification, increasing the picture quality and equipping product descriptions, and making educational content. Social implications: The existence of {TikTok} Shop is increasing the number of cosmetics products and competitors because of product’s excessive availability in the market. In the social benefit context, the Generation Z Muslim women can purchase and use various cosmetics product available on {TikTok} Shop, but customers must be on guard by knowing the cosmetics material to prevent the healthiness. In addition, the existence of {TikTok} Shop and the impulsive purchases by the Generation Z Muslim women are also increasing the retailer or local cosmetics producer income. Originality/value: This study is a contribution to consumer behaviour literature by raising the Stimulus–Organism–Response framework used in determining the factors influencing browsing and impulsive consumption of cosmetic products on {TikTok} Shop. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We assess whether the increasing visibility of French hijabi fashion bloggers like these is changing attitudes about the integration of Muslims in France. The media construction of French Muslim identity and its resulting Islamophobia have created an ‘imaginary Islam’ steeped in negativism and racialised stigma, according to some scholars, to which our surveyed influencers respond, manipulating Orientalist tropes to foster ambiguities about religion, sexuality, and race. In drawing attention to dynamic, consumption-based intersections of modest fashion marketing, ‘erasure,’ and processes of meaning-making, we argue that hijabi French Muslim fashion bloggers are increasingly positioning themselves as ‘cyberarbiters’ of social transformation and shifting attitudes about the intersections of Islam, the body, and female sexuality. © 2021 Westburn Publishers Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 29 hijab-wearing women in Turkey. The authors collected data in June–November 2020. Findings: Findings show that hijab fashion functions as encouragement, attraction, modesty and social image among Turkish Muslim women. This study also shows that social media and influencers change the meaning of the hijab while promoting hijab fashion. Findings reveal that Instagram boutiques act as digital fashion magazines, which enable women to integrate faster into popular culture today. While influencers have increased the number of hijab-wearing women, they have also turned the hijab into a commodity in the market by degenerating its true meaning. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations regarding the sample and geographic context of consumers. This study may not represent Turkish Muslim women’s behavior as our sample consists of 29 women. Therefore, larger samples are needed to generalize our findings. Undertaking cross-cultural studies will also enable marketers to make cultural comparisons. Practical implications: This study offers some insights for Islamic marketing practitioners in terms of influencer using in hijab fashion. Originality/value: This study adds to the previous research on hijab fashion and hijab consumption on Instagram. This study also extends the previous literature by examining the role of social media and influencers in hijab fashion.

As an influencer, she markets this image of the "modern Muslim woman"to her followers on Instagram, showing them that they too can have a similar life if they consume particular products and perform certain actions. I argue that Cummings has expanded the definition of the "modern Muslim woman"to include a commitment to racial justice, following the Prophetic model of supporting marginalized community. Rather than dismantling the "modern Muslim woman"image, which traditionally excludes Black women, she expands the image to center Black women and Black issues. © 2022 Koninklijke Brill {NV}, Leiden.},

Still, there is a dearth of research on the subjective importance of Black American women’s social media use and risks for social media addiction. This study tested the association between social media use integration and social media addiction, and whether connectedness to Black women moderated this relationship. Data from 354 Black American women (Mage = 24.34 years) were collected using an online survey. We found that social media use integration was positively associated with social media addiction. Connectedness to Black women moderated this relation, such that the positive association between social media use integration and social media addiction was magnified at a higher level of connectedness to Black women.

Nonetheless, the prevalence of online misogyny is worsening across virtual contexts. This study employs online interviews with Nigerian women on Facebook to examine the manifestations, effects, and strategies for navigating online misogyny. Findings reveal that feminism, a budding feature of the Nigerian social media is fast becoming a central motivating factor for online misogyny. Consequently, women’s increasing online engagements are sparking incidents of misogyny that consciously serve to limit their online voices and visibility. Women’s experiences of online misogyny are interrogated as iterative of mainstream patriarchal ideology while muted group theory portraying women’s positioning as a traditionally muted group in mainstream society is deployed to unpack the constructions of misogyny and silencing. Findings challenge common portrayals of social media as gender-neutral environments. Misogynists attack women who adopt feminist tags and those considered pushovers. In response, women adopt a two-tier strategy: “moral persuasion” or “going hard” to deal with online abuse. This approach constitutes serious emotional labour on the part of women and despite its utility, remains unsustainable in fighting online misogyny. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Particularly salient on social media is the lack of rules, etiquette or social taboos around racism controlling what people post and how they express themselves. This allows comments that are blatantly racist and antagonistic rather than concealed and subtle as is more socially acceptable in offline spaces. Using critical discourse analysis, the article will delve into the rhetorical and linguistic strategies the posters use to deny that racism toward Muslims can exist. It will expose how the denial of anti-Muslim racism is used in attempts to silence Muslims and anti-racists as well as to convince the general public that Muslims deserve the ill treatment they receive. However, exposing the strategies of racism deniers gives us a better understanding of how to resist such discourses. © 2022 by the author.},

Based on the results of three searches, 386 studies were retrieved and coded. Comparisons were made across all {LGB} individuals (138 studies), between {LGB} and heterosexual individuals (65 studies), and between {LGB} females and males (53 studies), with over 500,000 participants. Multiple types of victimization were coded, including discrimination, physical assault, and school victimization. Findings revealed that for {LGB} individuals, reports of victimization experiences were substantial (e.g., 55\% experienced verbal harassment, and 41\% experienced discrimination) and some types have increased since a 1992 review, while others have decreased. {LGB} individuals experienced greater rates of victimization than heterosexual individuals (range: d=.04-.58). {LGB} males experienced some types of victimization more than {LGB} females (e.g., weapon assault and being robbed) but, overall, the gender differences were small. It can be concluded that {LGB} individuals still experience a substantial amount of victimization. Implications for research methods are discussed, including recommendations for sampling and measurement of victimization. [Supplementary materials are available for this article.

First, we find that online harassment against journalists follows a systematic process that starts from the top, is followed through by a network of social media personalities and an army of trolls, and then completed by ordinary social media users. Second, cases of harassment impact journalists across multiple levels: individually, interpersonally and professionally. Finally, the participants referred to different ways of coping with what they experienced and identified three sources of support: their peers, their organizations and the public. Harassment against journalists has always been gendered, with women journalists finding themselves at the receiving end more often than do their male counterparts, and this has spilled over into digital platforms. © 2021 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Those stories did not only strike the silence that had long hid the perpetrators, but also allowed women to discharge some of their bottled-up grievances, and revealed many important information surrounding sexual harassment. In this paper, we present our analysis of about one million such tweets collected between October 15 and October 31, 2017 that reveals some interesting patterns and attributes of the people, place, emotions, actions, and reactions related to the tweeted stories. Based on our analysis, we also advance the discussion on the potential role of online social media in breaking the silence of women by factoring in the strengths and limitations of these platforms. © Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

However, body positive content is heterogeneous, and the processes underpinning the effects of body positive social media content on body image are not well understood. The aim of this study was to qualitatively examine variations in reactions to different types of body positive images among young people and their perceptions of the underlying processes. A sample of n=33 people, 67\% cisgender women, aged 14–25, mean ({SD}) = 19.6 (2.57) years, were interviewed. Thematic analysis revealed that body positive content highlighting the unrealistic nature of social media and inclusive in its broad portrayals of beauty were evaluated as most helpful. Two main processes were identified: (1) the broadening of understandings of beauty and greater inclusivity; and (2) the modeling of positive body image and active resistance to appearance ideals. However, these effects may vary according to content creators’ characteristics as well as individuals’ own body image concerns and their perceived proximity to those portrayed. Additional work across age, gender, and other identities is warranted to identify the most useful types of content for different individuals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, a series of meta-analyses were conducted on k = 30 studies (247 effect sizes) to examine risk factors for radicalization in youth, yielding significant effects for 15 out of 17 risk domains, ranging in magnitude from r = 0.080 to r = 0.482. Medium positive effects were found for activism, perceived in-group superiority and perceived distance to other people, while small effects were found for gender, personality, delinquency and aggression, lower educational level, negative peers, in-group identification, perceived discrimination, perceived group threat, perceived procedural injustice, perceived illegitimacy of authorities, and other, whereas the effect for poverty was very small. Moderator analyses showed that the risks of negative parenting and societal disconnection were smaller for right-wing radicalization than for religious or unspecified radicalization. The risks of personality and perceived group threat were greater for willingness to carry out extremist acts and extremist behavior than for attitude towards radicalization. Further, when the percentage of ethnic minorities in the sample increased, the risks of personality, negative parenting, and societal disconnection for radicalization were larger.},

	abstract = {Abstract There is a commonplace but powerful argument that links the religious resurgence in the Muslim world to the urban ecology of overcrowded slums in the large cities. Poverty and precarious life, together with anomie and lawlessness, condition the dispossessed to embrace ideologies and movements that offer communities of salvation and support while preaching radical politics. This article questions the premises of such arguments in an attempt to nuance the relationship between the urban dispossessed and radical Islam. By examining the politics of slums and militant Islamism in the Middle East, notably Egypt and Iran, I suggest that key to the habitus of the dispossessed is not anomie or extremism but ?informal life?? one that is characterized by flexibility, pragmatism, negotiation, as well as constant struggle for survival and self-development. The relationship between the urban dispossessed and radical Islamists tends to be both contingent and instrumental. Résumé On rencontre communément une thèse convaincante qui relie le renouveau religieux du monde musulman à l'écologie urbaine des quartiers pauvres et surpeuplés des grandes villes. Pauvreté et précarité, associées à anomie et non-droit, poussent les déshérités à rallier des idéologies ou mouvements qui proposent des communautés de salut et de soutien tout en prêchant des politiques radicales. Cet article revient sur les postulats utilisés et tente de nuancer le lien entre exclus urbains et Islam radical. En étudiant les politiques des quartiers pauvres et l'islamisme militant au Moyen-Orient, notamment en Egypte et Iran, il suggère que la clé de l'habitus des déshérités ne tient ni à l'anomie ni à l'extrémisme mais à une existence ?hors cadres?? dominée par la flexibilité, le pragmatisme et la négociation, autant que par une lutte permanente pour la survie et le développement personnel. Finalement, la relation entre exclus urbains et islamistes radicaux paraît à la fois plutôt contingente et instrumentale.},

	doi = {10.5334/irsp.573},
	abstract = {The present research aimed to extend the existing literature on political extremes’ symmetries and asymmetries, by examining the relationship between political extremism and perceived societal anomie (i.e., perceptions that the leadership is disregulated and that the social fabric is disintegrated) across three studies conducted within French samples. The first two studies revealed that perceived leadership disregulation increased as participants position themselves toward either political extreme and was associated with greater support for proposals regarding protectionism and economic redistribution; indicating a symmetry between political extremes. However, perceived social fabric disintegration was not associated with political extremism but was stronger for far-right individuals; thus suggesting an asymmetry between the extremes. The last study, conducted before the 2017 French Presidential elections, showed that, when imagining a future society in which the candidate they supported is elected as President, political extremes, compared to moderates, similarly reported reduced levels of leadership disregulation, but not social fabric disintegration. The present findings therefore suggest both similarities and differences between political extremes’ perception of anomie within current and future French society and extend previous work showing that political extremes share negative views of society.},

The purpose of this article is to offer such an integration. We feature a motivational construct, the quest for significance, defined as the need to have social worth. This need is typically fulfilled by a sense of measuring up to the values one shares with significant others. Our significance-quest theory ({SQT}) assumes that the need for significance is universal, whereas the means of satisfying it depend on the sociocultural context in which one?s values are embedded. Those means are identified in a narrative supported and validated by one?s network, or reference group. The quest for significance is activated by significance loss and/or the opportunity for significance gain. It motivates behavior that aims to affirm, realize, and/or show commitment to an important value. The {SQT} is consistent with large bodies of prior research and supported by novel studies in multiple laboratory and field settings. It transcends prior understandings and offers guidance for further study of this essential human motivation.},

We test a number of theories about how the unique combination of affordances on {TikTok} shapes how it is used for political communication. Compared to the dominant platform for political videos ({YouTube}) we find that a higher percentage of {TikTok} users upload videos, {TikTok} view counts are more dominated by virality, and viewership of videos are less dependent on a given accounts’ number of followers/subscribers. We discuss how these findings affect the production of content that ultimately determines the experience of {TikTok} consumers.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

We rely on recent literature comparing public opposition towards Muslims in general and opposition to Muslims’ religious practices, such as the wearing of the hijab. Based on a cross-nationally harmonized field experiment on hiring discrimination, we use two different signals of Muslimness (volunteering activities in a Muslim community centre or wearing the Muslim headscarf) to identify whether employers discriminate against Muslims as a group or against Muslims adhering to specific Muslim practices—in this case, wearing the headscarf. We present robust evidence that veiled Muslim women are discriminated against in Germany and the Netherlands, but only when applying for jobs that require a high level of customer contact. In Spain, however, the level of discrimination against veiled Muslim women is much smaller than in the other two countries. The high level of discrimination we found in the Netherlands, where the institutional context has traditionally been open to the accommodation of religious minority rights, is particularly surprising and points to the possibly stigmatizing effect of recent policies geared towards the cultural assimilation of immigrants.},

This article draws on three waves of research exploring the experiences of individuals currently or formerly involved in fringe communities, including the different stages of investment they progressed through, and ultimately, what made people leave. We propose a pathway model for understanding contemporary online radicalisation, including potential interventions that could be safely made at each stage. Insight into the experience of being immersed in these communities is essential for engaging with these people empathetically, and therefore preventing both the emergence of violent terrorists and protecting vulnerable people from being drawn into these communities.},

One key factor that may promote radicalization is social exclusion, the state of being kept apart from others. Indeed, experimental studies have provided initial evidence for a relation between exclusion and radicalism. The current review outlines and builds upon these research programs, arguing that social exclusion has been shown (a) to increase the willingness to fight-and-die, (b) to promote the approval for extreme, even violent, political parties and actions, and (c) to push the willingness to engage in illegal and violent action for a political cause.

	doi = {10.1016/j.eurpsy.2018.03.001},
	abstract = {Background: A new model of radicalisation has appeared in Western countries since the 2010s. Radical groups are smaller, less hierarchical and are mainly composed of young, homegrown individuals. The aim of this review is to decipher the profiles of the European adolescents and young adults who have embraced the cause of radical Islamism and to define the role of psychiatry in dealing with this issue. Methods: We performed a systematic search in several databases from January 2010 to July 2017 and reviewed the relevant studies that included European adolescents and/or young adults and presented empirical data. Results: In total, 22 qualitative and quantitative studies were reviewed from various fields and using different methodologies. Psychotic disorders are rare among radicalised youths. However, they show numerous risk factors common with adolescent psychopathologies. We develop a comprehensive three-level model to explain the phenomenon of radicalisation among young Europeans: (1) individual risk factors include psychological vulnerabilities such as early experiences of abandonment, perceived injustice and personal uncertainty; (2) micro-environmental risk factors include family dysfunction and friendships with radicalised individuals; (3) societal risk factors include geopolitical events and societal changes such as Durkheim's concept of anomie. Some systemic factors are also implicated as there is a specific encounter between recruiters and the individual. The former use sectarian techniques to isolate and dehumanise the latter and to offer him a new societal model. Conclusion: There are many similarities between psychopathological manifestations of adolescence and mechanisms at stake during the radicalisation process. As a consequence, and despite the rarity of psychotic disorders, mental health professionals have a role to play in the treatment and understanding of radical engagement among European youth. Studies with empirical data are limited, and more research should be promoted (in particular in females and in non-Muslim communities) to better understand the phenomenon and to propose recommendations for prevention and treatment.

	abstract = {The phenomena of closed and open mindedness are at the heart of the interface between cognitive and social processes. Every intelligible judgment, decision, or action rests on a subjective knowledge base held with at least a minimal degree of confidence. Formation of such knowledge requires that we shut off our minds to further relevant information that we could always strive and often manage to acquire. The relation of closed mindedness processes and social cognition and behavior is twofold. First, other people or groups of people often are the targets of our judgments, impressions, or stereotypes. Second, they are often our sources of information, and their opinions, judgments, and attitudes exert an important influence on our own. Thus, closed mindedness phenomena impact on what we think of others as well as how we think, in terms of the sources of information we take into account when forming our own opinions. The present volume highlights the motivational aspect of closed and open mindedness, discusses its antecedents and its consequences, and reports a body of empirical research exploring closed mindedness phenomena in a variety of domains.

And how does the transformation of territorial boundaries affect the scope and content of political conflicts?

While the mobilization of the losers of the processes of globalization by new right populist parties is seen to be the driving force of the restructuring of West European politics, the book goes beyond party politics. It attempts to show how the cleavage coalitions that are shaping up under the impact of globalization extend to state actors, interest groups and social movement organizations, and how the new conflicts are framed by the various actors involved. © Hanspeter Kriesi, Edgar Grande, Martin Dolezal, Marc Helbling, Dominic Höglinger, Swen Hutter and Bruno Wüest 2012.},

	abstract = {The article examines a number of ways in which the use of artificial intelligence technologies to predict the performance of individuals and to reach decisions concerning the entitlement of individuals to positive decisions impacts individuals and society. It analyses the effects using a social justice lens. Particular attention is paid to the experiences of individuals who have historically experienced disadvantage and discrimination. The article uses the university admissions process where the university utilises a fully automated decision-making process to evaluate the capability or suitability of the candidate as a case study. The article posits that the artificial intelligence decision-making process should be viewed as an institution that reconfigures the relationships between individuals, and between individuals and institutions. Artificial intelligence decision-making processes have institutional elements embedded within them that result in their operation disadvantaging groups who have historically experienced discrimination. Depending on the manner in which an artificial intelligence decision-making process is designed, it can produce solidarity or segregation between groups in society. There is a potential for the operation of artificial intelligence decision-making processes to fail to reflect the lived experiences of individuals and as a result to undermine the protection of human diversity. Some of these effects are linked to the creation of an ableist culture and to the resurrection of eugenics-type discourses. It is concluded that one of the contexts in which human beings should reach decisions is where the decision involves representing and evaluating the capabilities of an individual. The legislature should respond accordingly by identifying contexts in which it is mandatory to employ human decision-makers and by enacting the relevant legislation.},

Our findings show that 21 analysed documents look both at individual and societal impacts, with their understanding generally aligned in calls for more responsibility, accountability, transparency, safety or trust. Furthermore, our findings also point to the necessity of more integrated approaches between governments, industry and academia stakeholders, and above all, to the need of applied multidisciplinary frameworks, supported by both anticipatory outlooks and public engagement exercises able to tackle the often excessive technicality of the debate.},

In particular, this piece focuses on the ways in which Reddit?s karma point system, aggregation of material across subreddits, ease of subreddit and user account creation, governance structure, and policies around offensive content serve to provide fertile ground for anti-feminist and misogynistic activism. The ways in which these events and communities reflect certain problematic aspects of geek masculinity are also considered.

	abstract = {The dramatic increase in social media use has challenged traditional social structures and shifted a great deal of interpersonal communication from the physical world to cyberspace. Much of this social media communication has been positive: Anyone around the world who has access to the Internet has the potential to communicate with and attract a massive global audience. Unfortunately, such ubiquitous communication can be also used for negative purposes such as cyberbullying, which is the focus of this paper. Previous research on cyberbullying, consisting of 135 articles, has improved the understanding of why individuals?mostly adolescents?engage in cyberbullying. However, our study addresses two key gaps in this literature: (1) how the information technology ({IT}) artifact fosters/inhibits cyberbullying and (2) why people are socialized to engage in cyberbullying. To address these gaps, we propose the social media cyberbullying model ({SMCBM}), which modifies Akers? [Akers {RL} (2011) Social Learning and Social Structure: A General Theory of Crime and Deviance, 2nd ed. (Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, {NJ})] social structure and social learning model. Because Akers developed his model for crimes in the physical world, we add a rich conceptualization of anonymity composed of five subconstructs as a key social media structural variable in the {SMCBM} to account for the {IT} artifact. We tested the {SMCBM} with 1,003 adults who have engaged in cyberbullying. The empirical findings support the {SMCBM}. Heavy social media use combined with anonymity facilitates the social learning process of cyberbullying in social media in a way that fosters cyberbullying. Our results indicate new directions for cyberbullying research and implications for anticyberbullying practices.},

	abstract = {The Internet boosts immeasurably our collective capacity to archive information, search through large quantities of it quickly, and retrieve it rapidly. It is said that the Internet will expand access to education, good jobs, and better health and that it will create new deliberative spaces for political discussion and provide citizens with direct access to government. Insofar as such claims are plausible, Internet access is an important resource, and inequality in Internet access is a significant concern for social scientists who study inequality. This chapter reviews what we know about inequality in access to and use of new digital technologies. Until recently most research has focused on inequality in access (the "digital divide"), measured in a variety of ways. We agree that inequality of access is important, because it is likely to reinforce inequality in opportunities for economic mobility and social participation. At the same time we argue that a more thorough understanding of digital inequality requires placing Internet access in a broader theoretical context and asking a wider range of questions about the impact of information technologies and informational goods on social inequality. This chapter is structured around five key issues: 1. The digital divide. Who has access to the Internet, who does not have access, and how has access changed? This is the topic about which information is currently most abundant. 2. Is access to and use of the Internet more or less unequal than access to and use of other forms of information technology? Even if access to and use of the Internet is profoundly unequal, the Internet's spread may represent a net increase in equality over the pre-Web media landscape. The implications of the new digital technologies for inequality in access to information can be understood only in the context of a comparative analysis of the impact of inequality on access to and use of all the major communication media-not just the Internet but broadcast media, newspapers and magazines, telephones, and even word of mouth. If publishers stopped printing newspapers and put all the news online, would inequality in information about politics and world affairs diminish, become greater, or stay the same? 3. Among the increasing number of Internet users, how do such factors as gender, race, and socioeconomic status shape inequality in ease, effectiveness, and quality of use? What mechanisms account for links between individual attributes and technological outcomes? We place great importance on understanding socially structured variation in the ability of persons with formal access to the Internet to use it to enhance their access to valuable information resources. In particular, we are interested in the impact of social inequality on where, how easily, and with how much autonomy people can go online; the quality of the hardware and connection that users have at their disposal; how skilled users are at finding information; how effectively they can draw on social support in solving problems that they encounter in their efforts to do so; and how productively they use their Internet access to enhance their economic life chances and capacity for social and political participation. 4. Does access to and use of the Internet affect people's life chances? From the standpoint of public policy, the digital divide is only a problem insofar as going online shapes Internet users' life chances and capacity for civic engagement. What do we know about the effects of Internet access and use on such things as educational achievement and attainment, labor force participation, earnings, and voting? To what extent, if at all, do returns vary for different types of users? If there are no effects, or if the benefits for use are restricted to the already advantaged, then the case for government intervention to reduce inequality in access to digital technologies is correspondingly weaker.1 5. How might the changing technology, regulatory environment, and industrial organization of the Internet render obsolete the findings reported here? Because the Internet is a relatively new technology-browsers have been available for only about a decade and the Web was not fully privatized until the mid-1990s-we cannot assume that the results of research undertaken in past years will be replicated even a few years hence. The Internet is a moving target, with many economic and political interests vying to control its ultimate configuration. How might institutional changes-in economic control, in the codes that drive the technology, or in government regulatory and legislative actions-alter observed patterns of inequality in access and use? We begin with a brief account of the origins and spread of Internet technology. Next, in order to place this chapter in a broader perspective, we review earlier attempts to address the relationship between technological change and social inequality. Finally, we review the literature on each of the five main questions and, where the research is lacking, develop an agenda for the work that needs to be done.2.},

Using  survey data from a national sample of U.S. participants (N = 2,925) that we  collected during the early months of the pandemic, we analyzed how  sociodemographics, living arrangements, and Internet experiences and skills  relate to increases and decreases in various digital communication methods. We  find that people privileged in their socioeconomic status, their Internet skills  and online experiences are more likely to increase and less likely to decrease  digital communication during the pandemic. The findings illustrate how digital  inequalities can put already disadvantaged groups at greater risk of diminished  social contact during a public health crisis. We discuss the theoretical  implications of our findings for digital inequality research, the practical  implications for inclusive crisis responses, and directions for future research.},

Current research tends to focus on the Internet's implications in five domains: 1) inequality (the "digital divide"); 2) community and social capital; 3) political participation; 4) organizations and other economic institutions; and 5) cultural participation and cultural diversity. A recurrent theme across domains is that the Internet tends to complement rather than displace existing media and patterns of behavior. Thus in each domain, utopian claims and dystopic warnings based on extrapolations from technical possibilities have given way to more nuanced and circumscribed understandings of how Internet use adapts to existing patterns, permits certain innovations, and reinforces particular kinds of change. Moreover, in each domain the ultimate social implications of this new technology depend on economic, legal, and policy decisions that are shaping the Internet as it becomes institutionalized. Sociologists need to study the Internet more actively and, particularly, to synthesize research findings on individual user behavior with macroscopic analyses of institutional and political-economic factors that constrain that behavior.]},

I use the results of a large qualitative study of transnational families, conducted in Australia, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Iran, Singapore and New Zealand, to examine how and whether kin maintain contact across time and space. The research demonstrates that {ICTs} are more available for some people than for others. However, also and possibly more important in the decisions people make about using particular communication technologies are the social and cultural contexts of family life, which render some {ICTs} more desirable than others at specific points in time. Acknowledging this provides an important corrective to economic analyses of transnationalism, and contributes to theorizing and documenting the role of {ICTs} in the maintenance of transnational social networks.},

Low-cost calls serve as a kind of social glue connecting small-scale social formations across the globe. In this article I present recent data on the rapid growth and diffusion of telephone traffic and describe the proliferation of prepaid phonecards. Second, I outline the commercial, social and geographical ramifications of this explosion in transnational communication.},

The paper also presents as a case study, a sentiment analysis, and term-linkage network for one perpetrator?s total 3,000 tweets. Several themes were found in the data?there were shooters who changed their posting habits and in some cases, stopped using social media entirely in the lead up to their crime; shooters who used hate speech and were ?radicalized? to violence online; shooters with a demonstrable interest in violence, who referenced past mass shooters in their own communications; shooters who exhibited signs of mental illness and suicidality; shooters who were already known to authorities; and shooters who like those described above, actively posted while shooting, presumably to boost their own celebrity status. The findings from this study provide insight into commonalities among mass shooters in terms of their social media usage, which could lead to new pathways for prevention and intervention.},

Recently a "contagion" effect  has been suggested wherein the occurrence of one mass shooting increases the  likelihood of another mass shooting occurring in the near future. Although  contagion is a convenient metaphor used to describe the temporal spread of a  behavior, it does not explain how the behavior spreads. Generalized imitation is  proposed as a better model to explain how one person's behavior can influence  another person to engage in similar behavior. Here we provide an overview of  generalized imitation and discuss how the way in which the media report a mass  shooting can increase the likelihood of another shooting event. Also, we propose  media reporting guidelines to minimize imitation and further decrease the  likelihood of a mass shooting.},

Initial empirical studies of that deconstruct those concepts. The paper gives an overview of these attempts, including several undertaken by the author. It shows that the organizational development of Islam in Germany and the intergenerational change of its clientele have little correspondence with the conditions for inclusion established by the discourse of the German majority. At the same time, the discourse itself proves to be complex and more determined by conflicting interests between various groups within the Muslim and German communities than simply a Muslim–German divide.},

This paper presents a novel methodological framework for studying mobilization strategies of far-right groups on {TikTok}, employing a mixed-method approach that combines manual annotation, unsupervised image classification, and named-entity recognition to analyze the dynamics of radical visuals at scale. Differentiating between internal and external mobilization, we use popularity and engagement cues to investigate far-right mobilization efforts on {TikTok} within and outside their community. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness of unsupervised image classification when utilized within a broader mixed-method framework, as each observed far-right group employs unique platform characteristics. While Conspiracists flourish in terms of overall popularity and internal mobilization, nationalist and protest content succeeds by using a variety of persuasive visual content to attract and engage external audiences. The study contributes to existing literature by bridging the gap between visual political communication at scale and radicalization research. By offering insights into mobilization strategies of far-right groups, our study provides a foundation for policymakers, researchers, and online platforms to develop proactive measures to address the risks associated with the dissemination of extremist ideologies on social media.\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;/div\&gt;},

Interviewees discussed two vignettes (one familiar, the other relatively unfamiliar) in each of three different content domains (religious, ethical and environmental). Attempts were also made to increase individuals' integrative complexity of thought about each dilemma by means of several "prodding" questions. Across domains, complexity of thought was significantly higher for familiar than for unfamiliar vignettes. Also, we were successful in increasing respondents' complexity levels with our graduated prompts. Dispositional measures (religious fundamentalism, Christian orthodoxy, right-wing authoritarianism, dogmatism, and need for cognition) were related to complexity of thought, but these associations were not consistent across domains. In particular, we concluded that religious fundamentalism and orthodoxy were negatively related to complexity of thought for existential issues only, and a reconsideration of previous investigations suggested that this is in fact a consistent tendency in related research.]},

The proposal is straightforward-extreme subjective uncertainty, particularly relating to self-conception, motivates people to define themselves, via self-categorization and social identification processes, in terms of the highly consensual, distinctive, and clearly focused prototypes of high entitativity groups. This analysis is framed by the social identity perspective, and develops the uncertainty reduction theory of social identity motivation to incorporate notions of entitativity. The chapter opens by examining the general question of what is the relationship between uncertainty, identity, and totalism. The author then briefly review key aspects of the social identity perspective and outline in detail the uncertainty reduction hypothesis. The author extends the analysis with a conceptual discussion of prototypicality and entitativity and describe some relevant studies. The chapter closes with some concluding comments.

	abstract = {While I write this chapter, millions of people in the Darfur province of Sudan have been terrorized off their land; the entire population of Iraq has little idea what the future of their country will be; survivors of hurricane Katrina are dispersed across the United States; people in Britain are anxious about immigration and are toying with the idea of supporting the British National Party; people in a small town in Tasmania wait to hear if members of their community have been found alive in a mine collapse; air travelers the world over have no idea what new security arrangements await them when they get to the airport; and we all wonder about the consequences of further escalation in the price of oil and of the standoff over Iran's uranium enrichment program. The world is an uncertain place, it always has been, and these uncertainties can make it very difficult to predict or plan our lives and to feel sure about the type of people we are. In this chapter, I describe how feelings of uncertainty, particularly about or related to self, motivate people to identify with social groups and to choose new groups with, or configure existing groups to have, certain properties that best reduce, control, or protect from feelings of uncertainty. I consider this uncertainty–identity theory to be a development of the motivational component of social identity theory. It addresses why, when, and how strongly people identify with groups, and why groups may have particular generic properties in certain contexts. Of particular relevance to contemporary postmodern society, uncertainty reduction theory provides an account of zealotry and the cult of the “true believer” in the thrall of ideology and powerful leadership—an account of conditions that may spawn extremism, a silo mentality, and a loss of moral or ethical perspective. In this chapter, I describe uncertainty–identity theory and some conceptual elaborations and applications, review direct and indirect empirical tests, and locate the theory in the context of related ideas and theories in social psychology. I start with a historical sketch of why, when, and how uncertainty–identity theory was developed, then go on to discuss uncertainty reduction as a motivation for human behavior. I then detail the process by which group identification reduces uncertainty and describe a program of studies showing that people who feel uncertain are more likely to identify and identify more strongly with groups. High‐entitativity groups are best equipped to reduce uncertainty through identification—entitativity moderates the uncertainty–identification relation. I discuss this idea and describe research that supports it, and then extend the analysis to deal with extremism and totalistic groups—describing how extreme uncertainty may encourage strong identification (zealotry, fanaticism, being a true believer) with groups that are structured in a totalistic fashion. Again I describe some research supporting this idea. The next section deals with extensions, applications, and implications of uncertainty–identity theory. I discuss the relation between depersonalization and self‐projection processes in uncertainty‐motivated group identification, and then, in a subsection entitled central members, marginal members, leaders, and deviants, I focus on the role of group prototypicality in uncertainty reduction processes. The role of trust, the relation between uncertainty, identity, and ideology, and the role of uncertainty in social mobilization are also discussed. The final section, before concluding comments, discusses other theories, approaches, and topics that deal with constructs related to those discussed by uncertainty–identity theory. Specifically, I discuss uncertainty as a state versus a trait, with a focus on the constructs of need for cognitive closure and uncertainty orientation; the role played by culture in uncertainty; and the relevance of terror management, compensatory conviction, self‐verification, and system justification.},

	abstract = {Abstract Scholars in a number of disciplines have sought to assess the power of reading or viewing a personal story to modify people's beliefs. However, the research, which has been pursued under diverse programs, has produced conflicting findings. We focus on the persuasiveness of personal stories about problems that are structural (rather than individual) and whose solution requires government action. Overall, the research suggests that although personal stories can overcome people's tendency to resist new information, they often do not do so. People's preexisting beliefs, assumptions, and stereotypes affect their willingness to be absorbed by a story, to empathize with the stories' protagonists, and to endorse the message communicated by the story. We argue also for a sociological perspective on narrative persuasion, one which, unlike the mostly experimental research conducted so far, pays attention to the context in which people encounter stories and to the norms shaping people's assessment of a story as credible, relevant, and important.},

	abstract = {In this experiment, we examine effects of television dramas on support for controversial public policies (gay marriage and the death penalty) and explore mechanisms that may explain such effects. The dramas influenced support for death penalty but not gay marriage. As predicted, exposure to the relevant drama eliminated the relationship between prior ideology (conceptualized as a continuous variable) and death penalty support. Moreover, the valence of the relationship between prior (increasingly liberal) ideology and salience of a relevant value (perceived importance of a safe and crime-free society) went from negative in the comparison condition to positive after exposure to the relevant drama. These and other results suggest that a television narrative can influence policy support by reframing the dramatic situation to reduce the effect of prior ideology and values and by minimizing processing of the story as intentionally persuasive discourse.},

Given the two growing phenomena of “online radicalization” and “behavioral/ideological/organizational de-radicalization,” this article outlines a broad strategy for countering the narratives of violent extremists. It argues that an effective counter-narrative should be built on three pillars. The first is an effective comprehensive message that dismantles and counter-argues against every dimension of the extremist narrative, namely the theological, political, historical, instrumental and socio-psychological dimensions. The second pillar is the messengers. The article argues that for the first time in the history of Jihadism a “critical mass” of former militants, who rebelled not only against the current behaviour of their former colleagues but also against the ideology supporting it, has come into existence. This “critical mass” can constitute the core of credible messengers, especially the few de-radicalized individuals and groups that still maintain influence and respect among vulnerable communities. The third pillar is the dissemination and attraction strategy of the counter-narratives(s) which focuses on the role of the media. The author of the article outlines a broad framework, which is a part of a {UN}-sponsored, comprehensive research project on countering the extremists narrative.]},

We interviewed 19 {TikTok} creators about their motivations and practices of using algospeak in relation to their experience with {TikTok}?s content moderation.

The conversation itself combines a variety of topics to both describe Muslim identity in diaspora and to critique both Muslim community practices and conditions for Muslims in non-Muslim countries.},

Focusing on structure and practices, authority and hierarchy, and the broader connections with other (e-) communities, this paper argues that Latino Muslims are highly disconnected from the overall Muslim world and there should be an initiative to connect them with the Muslim world based on their needs, conceptions and perspectives.},

My focus is particularly on Muslim women's engagement with Islamic sources on the levels of existing interpretations and women's own readings. There is a diversity of views on different points and women expertly refer to the Qur'an and to the Prophetic traditions to support their respective positions. I argue that this variety of discourses is characteristic for Muslim women who have engaged with the concept of gender relations in Islam since the emergence of Islam. Finally, as this activity takes place online, the role of the Internet is considered in terms of facilitation of production of women's Islamic discourses. An examination of interactions between the women reveals fundamentally new patterns, specific to the online environments. Whereas Muslim women professing different views on gender relations in Islam tend not to engage in dialogue with each other in the off-line world, they participate in a common online debate which is more likely to result in shared understandings.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, marked by the supposedly universal access to different types of social media, we have seen the emergence of forms of popular feminism embedded in complex dynamics. Often cohabiting in these dynamics are ambivalent ideas and imaginaries that both reject and express feminist issues. Particularly during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, the use of digital technologies increased exponentially to overcome mobility constraints, popularizing connective action around feminism and, at the same time, reinforcing normative views of society. This article explores these ambivalences by focusing on {TikTok} discourses, whose popularity grew intensely during the pandemic. Departing from a feminist constructionist perspective and using content analysis, we examine the 100 most prominent videos on the Portuguese hashtags \#feminismo (\#feminism) and \#antifeminismo (\#antifeminism) in the period corresponding to general containment measures in the second phase of the public health crisis. The results are less than encouraging. Over half of the analysed videos contain discursive dynamics conforming to social hierarchization (53\%), often reaffirming gender stereotypes. By allowing forms of popular feminism and antifeminism to permeate the shared discourses, the results suggest that the platform gives rise to ideas and discourses that reify unbalanced power relations.},

Drawing on the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the concept of self-relevance, the present study explores the impact of perceived personalization of {TikTok} content on perceived creativity, authenticity, and viral behavioral intentions. The relationships between perceived creativity and authenticity and between viral behavioral intentions and purchase intentions are also examined. The results show that the personalization of {TikTok} content is positively related to perceived creativity and authenticity, which consequently lead to viral behavior intention on {TikTok}. In addition, perceived creativity of {TikTok} content is positively related to authenticity. The findings also suggest that need for uniqueness moderates the relationship between personalization and viral behavioral intentions. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into the roles of perceived creativity, authenticity, and need for uniqueness in the impact of {TikTok}’s personalized content on viral behavioral intentions.

In total, N = 762 posts were manually analyzed. The study shows that female politicians receive more likes when they are visible in a picture compared to male politicians. It also reveals that male and female politicians both refer more to feminine issues than to masculine issues, although the use of feminine issues resulted in less likes. We find that some issues lead to more discussion amongst Instagram users, and that this differs between male and female politicians.

In recent years, however, these debates have gained renewed momentum. Rapid technological change and increased use of digital media have raised questions about how digital technologies change, influence, and shape feminist politics. This book interrogates the digital interface of transnational protest movements and local activism in feminist politics. Examining how global feminist politics is articulated at the nexus of the transnational/national, we take contemporary German protest culture as a case study for the manner in which transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work. The book explores how movements and actions from outside Germany's borders circulate digitally and resonate differently in new local contexts, and further, how these border-crossings transform grass-roots activism as it goes digital. This book was originally published as a special issue of Feminist Media Studies.},

As China’s first emergent social media app making its mark across the Global North and South, it has prompted a shift in our global mediascape. Following in the footsteps of {YouTube} and Instagram after it, {TikTok} is facilitating new identities through User-Generated Content ({UGC}) while challenging the hegemony of American-led platform culture. {UGC} analyzed in this article views it unabashedly as a youthful narcissism through which a form of self-reinvention online is created. This is culturally surmised as an intriguing new form of global creativity that I label ecumenical {UGC}. Yet, scholarship has largely examined {TikTok} through empirical and content analysis frameworks only, negating the compelling cultural studies issues evinced in this trendy media. In conjunction with discussions of {TikTok}’s meteoric rise, this article also probes how the Chinese company that owns this app bends several {UNESCO} media principles, creating its mediatic split with its twin, Douyin operating only in the {PRC}. By laying out this other path, one detects a shrinkage of cultural globalization in the pandemic era as {TikTok} becomes a carrier of ‘underglobalization’ flows, a disrupter and provider of algorithmic content, all going under not against older notions of global culture. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Regarding news about jihadism, many researchers have observed that those who practice Islam are classified as a monolithic entity, and this entire religious group is generalized as a threat to modern societies. The main objective of our research is thus to know the discourses used on {TikTok} to respond to the binomial Islam = terrorism spread by mainstream media and the affordances of this platform used to challenge this miscon-ception. Using the snowball method, a multimodal analysis was conducted by identifying {TikTok} videos with the hashtags \#yihadista, \#yihad, and \#islamterrorismo (in its English and Spanish versions) to explore the uses of the {TikTok} platform. The resulting selection criteria included: (a) content related to mainstream media discourses on jihadism, (b) discussion of a topic related to Islam and terrorism, and (c) where the content creator declares him/herself to be a Muslim. In addi-tion, in‐depth interviews were conducted to provide an enhanced understanding of how the media promote the need to generate a counter‐narrative on {TikTok}. The results reveal that discourses from Muslims that combat Islam = terrorism discourses are constructed within the spiral of the dominant narrative, thus visualizing the negative discourses about Islam. © 2023 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: {TikTok} social media app has become one of the most popular forms of leisure and entertainment activities, but how hedonic consumption experiences (comprising fantasy, escapism, enjoyment, role projection, sensory, arousal and emotional involvement) of the {TikTok} app determine users' intention to use the app and its resulting impact on the actual usage behavior remains limited in the information systems literature, especially featuring the hedonic consumption perspective in entertainment industry. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs uses \& gratification theory to answer the “why” via predicting the role of hedonic consumption experiences that serve as gratifications to trigger technology acceptance behavior (especially, in form of users' behavioral intention to use the {TikTok} app and its further impact on usage behavior). This study utilizes the partial least squares-structural equation modeling approach to perform data analyses on 258 {TikTok} app users. Findings: Our results provide a strong support such that users' playful consumption experiences (i.e. escapism, role projection, arousal, sensory experience and enjoyment) positively influence their intention to use the {TikTok} app and its resultant effect on users' actual usage of the app. In contrast, fantasy and emotional involvement fail to influence users' intention to use the {TikTok} app. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, our investigation is one of the first studies to apply the hedonic consumption experiences as potential gratifications that derive users' intention and its subsequent influence on the actual usage of the {TikTok} app. Our study results would assist marketing and brand managers to redefine approaches and tactics to create effective strategies that implement essential determinants to increase behavioral intention among entertainment service providers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {{TikTok}, one of the fastest growing entertainment platforms, is also a burgeoning space for hosting political expressions and movements. In this study, we examine how Asian/American women creatively occupy the \#{StopAsianHate} hashtag on {TikTok} to counter anti-Asian racism and form pan-Asian solidarity. We analyze their participation in the \#{StopAsianHate} hashtag as anti-racist space-making practices, which we define as the act of carving out discursive spaces to spread counter-narratives to anti-Asian racism and claiming space through their agentive, visual presence. Drawing upon Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis ({CTDA}) as our method, we analyze 130 \#{StopAsianHate} {TikTok} videos by Asian/American women and examine how their anti-racist space-making practices draw upon the features and cultures of {TikTok}. We illustrate how Asian/American women extend the discussion on anti-Asian racism to include their gendered and raced experiences, and challenge racism in affective and evocative ways. We conclude by discussing how their space-making practices foster an ad hoc community for Asian/Americans across differences amid rising anti-Asian hate crimes. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {{TikTok}—the world’s most downloaded app since 2020, has become a place for more than silly dancing and lip-syncing. {TikTok} users are increasingly turning to {TikTok} for news content. Meanwhile, news publishers are embracing {TikTok} to reach a younger audience. We aim to examine the content strategy adopted by the most-followed news publishers on {TikTok} and how effective their {TikTok} strategy is in spurring audience engagement in terms of liking, commenting, and sharing. This study retrieved 101,292 {TikTok} news videos as of November 22, 2022. With the help of computer vision, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis, we found that {TikTok} news videos containing negative sentiment and more second-person view shots are associated with significantly higher audience engagement. In addition, this study demonstrated that the {TikTok} video features and engagement levels differ between the news publishers and other {TikTok} creators. Moderator analysis shows that both the effect of negative sentiment on engagement and the effect of the second-person view on engagement are moderated by the {TikTok} account type. The impact of negative sentiment and second-person view on engagement behaviors becomes smaller or even insignificant for news publisher {TikTok} videos. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in this study. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Purpose: {TikTok}, a social media application (app), was originally positioned as a short music video community suitable for young users, and the app is user-generated content ({UGC}) short video of vertical music. Users can make their own creative videos. Following the rhythm of the music, users can shoot various video content, personal talents, life records, performances, dances, plot interpretations, etc. However, what are the profiles and preferences of {TikTok} users, whereby the social media app is mainly developed by {UGC}? What is the impact of {TikTok} on the development of social media? In addition, what is {UGC}'s social media model for user interactions in social networks? The purpose of this paper is to address and study these proposed issues. Design/methodology/approach: All questionnaire items are designed as nominal and ordinal scales (not Likert scale). The obtained data from questionnaires are put into the relational database (N = 2,011). This empirical study takes Taiwan {TikTok} users as the research object, implements data mining analytics to generate user profiles through clustering analysis and further uses association rules’ analysis to analyze social media apps in social network interaction and social apps’ development by proposing two patterns and several meaningful rules. Findings: This study finds that social media apps is a valuable practical research topic on online social media development. In addition, besides the {TikTok}, the authors eagerly await subsequent research to provide more valuable findings of social media apps in both theory and practice. Originality/value: This study presents the research evidences that social media apps such as {TikTok} will be able to transcend the current development pattern of social media and make good use of the media and technology innovation of apps in social development and social informatics. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Although the short-video-based application {TikTok} and its {AI}-enhanced technology have achieved enormous success and reshaped the user experience, few studies have focused on the user experience in the {TikTok} context. This study adopts a technology affordance theory lens to identify the main mechanisms contributing to the user experience in the short-video platform context while including user experience level and video length as moderating effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 401 valid questionnaires from {TikTok} users and used the structural equation modeling approach to examine the proposed research model. Findings: Three technology affordances (perceived effortlessness, perceived recommendation accuracy, and perceived recommendation serendipity) contribute to {TikTok} users' optimal flow experience. Multi-group analysis results further indicate that individuals react differently to the same stimuli as their experience level increases. Finally, video length critically influences the impact of technology affordances on users' cognitive responses. Originality/value: As a burgeoning industry, the mechanisms enabling short-video platforms to engage users remain unclear to practitioners and researchers. Thus, this study's technology affordance lens provides necessary insights into how {TikTok}'s innovative and advanced technologies contribute to user flow experience from a context-dependent perspective. Furthermore, given that most existing studies have neglected possible variations in user preferences when investigating the effects of technology, this study enriches the existing literature by employing user experience level and video length as moderators. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Considering {TikTok}’s young demographic, these findings are more than alarming; {TikTok} even fails to apply its own Terms of Service, which do not allow content “deliberately designed to provoke or antagonize people, or are intended to harass, harm, hurt, scare, distress, embarrass or upset people or include threats of physical violence”. © 2021 by the authors.},

However, what is meant by the ‘subject’ is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers’ subjectification on {TikTok} as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers’ short-form {TikTok} videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on {TikTok} as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of {TikTok} for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies. At the same time, it suggests that platforms’ transnational affordances in Global South contexts occur independently to Northcentric frameworks and interpretations. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

I do so by drawing on findings from ethnographic fieldwork with young adult {TikTok} users based in the United Kingdom that was conducted in 2020 and 2021. I trace how using the app, specifically scrolling through the {TikTok} For You Page, the app’s algorithmic content feed, became a fixed part of the everyday routines of young adults. I show how {TikTok} appealed to them as a convenient means of escape and relief that they were unable to find elsewhere during and beyond times of lockdown. Further, I highlight the complex nature of {TikTok} as an app and the active role that users play in imagining and appropriating the app’s affordances as meaningful parts of their everyday social life. Closing the paper, I reflect on future directions of {TikTok} scholarship by stressing the importance of situated audience studies. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {{TikTok}, a short-video app featuring video content typically between 15 and 60 s long, has become immensely popular around the world in the last few years. However, the worldwide popularity of {TikTok} requires the platform to constantly negotiate with the rules, norms and regulatory frameworks of the regions where it operates. Failure to do so has had significant consequences. For example, for content-related reasons, the platform has been (temporarily and permanently) banned in several countries, including India, Indonesia and Pakistan. Moreover, its Chinese ownership and popularity among underage users have made the platform subject to heightened scrutiny and criticism. In this paper, we introduce the notion of visibility moderation, defined as the process through which digital platforms manipulate the reach of user-generated content through algorithmic or regulatory means. We discuss particular measures {TikTok} implements to shape visibility and issues arising from it. This paper presents findings from interviews with content creators, which takes a user-centric approach to understand their sense-making of and negotiation with {TikTok}'s visibility moderation. Findings from this study also highlight concerns that leave these stakeholders feeling confused, frustrated or powerless, which offer important directions for further research. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Despite their growing popularity, little research has focused on the association between Instagram and {TikTok} use and psychological well-being. Informed by Uses and Gratifications Theory, the present study investigates the flow states experienced when using each social media platform and whether these flow states differentially impact user well-being. A flow state is achieved when people are so engrossed in an activity that little else seems to matter to them and they will often continue the activity despite its negative consequences. Based upon a survey of adult Instagram (n = 195, Mage = 38) and {TikTok} users (n = 225, Mage = 37), the present study identified four unique clusters of users for both platforms based upon the levels of five flow dimensions: focused attention, curiosity, enjoyment, telepresence, and time distortion. Results found that {TikTok} users reported higher levels of overall flow than Instagram users. {TikTok} users also reported higher levels of the flow dimensions "enjoyment"and "time distortion."The flow dimension of "telepresence"(immersion in a world created by the social media application) for both {TikTok} and Instagram users was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. These social media may provide an escape from everyday worries for users, although a suboptimal coping strategy. Whether Instagram and {TikTok} use are but "improved means to an unimproved end"is an important question that requires additional research.  © 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

This study focused on the personality traits and narcissistic behavior of university students about whether they use {TikTok} or make a short-form video for getting attention to have self-esteem, need to belong, or need for admiration and how much time they spent on these social sites. The study focused to examine {TikTok} addiction by surveying 350 university students through a purposive sampling technique. The study found that a positive correlation exists between independent, dependent, and mediating variables. In addition to this, the results showed that only grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism have a direct effect on the {TikTok} addiction. On the other hand, the need for admiration has also a direct effect on {TikTok} addiction. For the specific indirect effect, neuroticism, which is a personality trait, has no indirect effect on the addition of {TikTok} through the mediators like need to belong, need for admiration, and self-esteem. This study highlights the contribution towards the media-related research that can be identified by the general public. Hence policymakers can make strategies for social media users to overcome addictive tendencies. Copyright © 2022 by Cherkas Global University.},

The recent growing popularity of {TikTok} has transformed the cultures and practices of social movements worldwide. Through the platform’s participatory affordances, many users find meaningful ways to engage with the platform and its cultures, by leading and participating in a variety of activist initiatives for global awareness, social change, and civic politics. Within this context, this introduction to the Special Issue titled “{TikTok} and Social Movements” begins by thinking about how social media pop cultures have served as a vehicle for mobilizing and engaging in social movements for social (in)justice and politics in the era of social media. By situating {TikTok}, a nascent platform and culture of short video, within the ongoing discussion of digitally mobilized movements and social justice, this introduction addresses several crucial points to consider when discussing {TikTok} cultures and social movements that are happening or interrupted on the platform. These points are interrogated with more details and cultural contexts in the five case studies and three expert commentaries in this Special Issue. Specifically, the collection of papers interrogate how {TikTok}’s interactive and creative affordances have augmented and altered our cultures, practices, politics, and power dynamics of engaging with publics for various beliefs and social agendas. © The Author(s) 2023.},

While its popularity is undeniable, at the first glance, it seems to offer features already available on previously existing and well-established platforms such as Instagram, {YouTube}, and Facebook. To understand processes of self-making on {TikTok}, we undertake two methods of data collection: a walkthrough of the app and its surrounding environment, and 14 semistructured participant interviews. A qualitative analysis of this data finds three distinct themes emerge: (1) awareness of the algorithm, (2) content without context, and (3) self-creation across platforms. These results show that {TikTok} departs from existing platforms in the model of self-making it engenders, which we term “the algorithmized self”—a complication of the pre-existing “networked self” framework. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {During the {COVID}-19 pandemic, health-related misinformation and harmful content shared online had a significant adverse effect on society.In an attempt to mitigate this adverse effect, mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and {TikTok} employed soft moderation interventions (i.e., warning labels) on potentially harmful posts.Such interventions aim to inform users about the post's content without removing it, hence easing the public's concerns about censorship and freedom of speech.Despite the recent popularity of these moderation interventions, as a research community, we lack empirical analyses aiming to uncover how these warning labels are used in the wild, particularly during challenging times like the {COVID}-19 pandemic.In this work, we analyze the use of warning labels on {TikTok}, focusing on {COVID}-19 videos.First, we construct a set of 26 {COVID}-19 related hashtags, and then we collect 41K videos that include those hashtags in their description.Second, we perform a quantitative analysis on the entire dataset to understand the use of warning labels on {TikTok}.Then, we perform an in-depth qualitative study, using thematic analysis, on 222 {COVID}-19 related videos to assess the content and the connection between the content and the warning labels.Our analysis shows that {TikTok} broadly applies warning labels on {TikTok} videos, likely based on hashtags included in the description (e.g., 99\% of the videos that contain \#coronavirus have warning labels).More worrying is the addition of {COVID}-19 warning labels on videos where their actual content is not related to {COVID}-19 (23\% of the cases in a sample of 143 English videos that are not related to {COVID}-19).Finally, our qualitative analysis on a sample of 222 videos shows that 7.7\% of the videos share misinformation/harmful content and do not include warning labels, 37.3\% share benign information and include warning labels, and that 35\% of the videos that share misinformation/harmful content (and need a warning label) are made for fun. Our study demonstrates the need to develop more accurate and precise soft moderation systems, especially on a platform like {TikTok} that is extremely popular among people of younger age.},

	abstract = {{TikTok} is an app that allows people to create, share, and consume short-video content. Although only available internationally since 2017, it has already been downloaded more than 2 billion times and has around 800 million active users. Public interest in the fleeting and seemingly random video clips that {TikTok} hosts is high. In fact, it has grown steadily since the time of the Twitter-owned short-video app Vine that ended its service in 2016 with only a quarter of {TikTok}’s current userbase. However, despite this steady growth in popularity, observations and theorizations of short-video apps like {TikTok} remain lacking. In this article, I thus seek to address this lack by critically discussing how to study short-video communications from the bottom up and by presenting the results of an exploratory investigation into {TikTok} and its communicative forms. Doing so, this article contributes to opening a space for serious engagement with this burgeoning yet understudied element of digital culture in the future.},

	abstract = {{TikTok} is commonly known as a playful, silly platform where teenagers share 15-second videos of crazy stunts or act out funny snippets from popular culture. In the past few years, it has experienced exponential growth and popularity, unseating Facebook as the most downloaded app. Interestingly, recent news coverage notes the emergence of {TikTok} as a political actor in the Indian context. They raise concerns over the abundance of divisive content, hate speech, and the lack of platform accountability in countering these issues. In this article, we analyze how politics is performed on {TikTok} and how the platform?s design shapes such expressions and their circulation. What does the playful architecture of {TikTok} mean to the nature of its political discourse and participation? To answer this, we review existing academic work on play, media, and political participation and then examine the case of Sabarimala through the double lens of ludic engagement and platform-specific features. The efficacy of play as a productive heuristic to study political contention on social media platforms is demonstrated. Finally, we turn to ludo-literacy as a potential strategy that can reveal the structures that order playful political participation and can initiate alternative modes of playing politics.},

The global growth of {TikTok}, while offering an engaging experience for users and approach to connecting to diverse people, is accompanied by concerns, such as the quality of health advice offered in videos and sensitive content.

	abstract = {Online communities provide spaces for people who are vulnerable and underserved to seek support and build community, such as {LGBTQ}+ people. Today, some online community spaces are mediated by algorithms. Scholarship has found that algorithms have become deeply embedded in the systems that mediate our routine engagements with the world. Yet, little is known about how these systems impact those who are most vulnerable in society. In this paper, we focus on people's everyday experiences with one algorithmic system, the short video sharing application {TikTok}. {TikTok} recently received press that it was suppressing and oppressing the identities of its growing {LGBTQ}+ user population through algorithmic and human moderation of {LGBTQ}+ creators and content related to {LGBTQ}+ identity. Through an interview study with 16 {LGBTQ}+ {TikTok} users, we explore people's everyday engagements and encounters with the platform. We find that {TikTok}'s For You Page algorithm constructs contradictory identity spaces that at once support {LGBTQ}+ identity work and reaffirm {LGBTQ}+ identity, while also transgressing and violating the identities of individual users. We also find that people are developing self-organized practices in response to these transgressions and violations. We discuss the implications of algorithmic systems on people's identity work, and introduce the concept of algorithmic exclusion, and explore how people are building resilience following moments of algorithmic exclusion.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;Since its release in 2017, the video sharing app {TikTok} has been downloaded 1.5 billion times. While its popularity has been attributed to the abundance of celebrity users, its interactive features, and its short, palatable video length, it has been the subject of relatively few academic studies. This project employs the walkthrough method to examine {TikTok} within the context of identity negotiation and self-representation on social media. More specifically, it seeks to understand whether {TikTok} follows a precedent set by other Social Networking Sites which support users self-representing via sociability “to the network, via the network”; i.e. by interacting within the affordances of the platform, which may include sharing, liking, commenting, etc (Papacharissi, 2013). This model ostensibly offers users a stage where they may display their individuality and curate content that reflects their personal interests. By regularly using the app for a period of a month and collecting extensive field notes, screenshots, and video recordings, we found that {TikTok}’s version of sociality differs from that offered by other {SNSs}. While other sites purport to be a tool with which users may represent their identities, {TikTok} does away with this conceit by engendering a mode of sociality (through its design features and affordances) in which the crux of interaction is not between users and their social network, but between a user and what we call an “algorithmized” version of self. This finding has the potential to enrich and complicate the discourse surrounding online identity formation and sociality.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

	abstract = {{TikTok} is a video-sharing social networking service, whose popularity is increasing rapidly. It was the world’s second-most downloaded app in 2019. Although the platform is known for having users posting videos of themselves dancing, lip-syncing, or showcasing other talents, user-videos expressing political views have seen a recent spurt. This study aims to perform a primary evaluation of political communication on {TikTok}. We collect a set of {US} partisan Republican and Democratic videos to investigate how users communicated with each other about political issues. With the help of computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical tools, we illustrate that political communication on {TikTok} is much more interactive in comparison to other social media platforms, with users combining multiple information channels to spread their messages. We show that political communication takes place in the form of communication trees since users generate branches of responses to existing content. In terms of user demographics, we find that users belonging to both the {US} parties are young and behave similarly on the platform. However, Republican users generated more political content and their videos received more responses; on the other hand, Democratic users engaged significantly more in cross-partisan discussions.},

	abstract = {Authenticity, generally regarded as coherence between one's inner self and outward behavior, is associated with myriad social values (e.g., integrity) and beneficial outcomes, such as psychological well-being. Scholarship suggests, however, that behaving authentically online is complicated by self-presentation norms that make it difficult to present a complex self as well as encourage sharing positive emotions and facets of self and discourage sharing difficult emotions. In this paper, we position authenticity as a self-presentation norm and identify the sociomaterial factors that contribute to the learning, enactment, and enforcement of authenticity on the short-video sharing platform {TikTok}. We draw on interviews with 15 U.S. {TikTok} users to argue that normative authenticity and understanding of {TikTok} as a "fun" platform are mutually constitutive in supporting a "just be you" attitude on {TikTok} that in turn normalizes expressions of both positive and difficult emotions and experiences. We consider the social context of {TikTok} and use an affordance lens to identify anonymity, of oneself and one's audience; association between content and the "For You" landing page; and video modality of {TikTok} as factors informing authenticity as a self-presentation norm. We argue that these factors similarly contribute to {TikTok}'s viability as a space for social support exchange and address the utility of the comments section as a site for both supportive communication and norm judgment and enforcement. We conclude by considering the limitations of authenticity as social norm and present implications for designing online spaces for social support and connection.},

At the same time, social media use, especially the video-sharing app {TikTok}, is increasing among teens. {TikTok}, therefore, offers a novel opportunity to make up for shortcomings in sex education and convey sexual health information to adolescents. To describe the availability and content of sexual education on {TikTok}, we conducted a content analysis of themes for 100 sex education?focused videos. We found that female anatomy was the most frequently addressed topic. Sexual pleasure was the second most common theme, within which discussions of the female orgasm and arousal constituted the most common subtheme. Other common themes include contraception and sexual health. These sought-after topics may be incongruent with those presented in standard school- or home-based sex education or interactions with health care providers, and this disconnect suggests opportunities for health care providers and educators to initiate conversations or offer resources on these themes as part of routine interaction. We conclude with recommendations for future research to consider the factual accuracy of sex education on {TikTok} and determine how exposure to this content affects adolescents? understanding of the risks and benefits of intercourse, sexual practices, age- and gender-based sexual norms, and other health behaviors.},

By using a qualitative method and feminist approach, the study focuses on the religious preachers on the new social media. This study shows that the large amounts of lectures with the gender-biased theme in social media are inseparable from the role of the promotional accounts. It shares videos of gender-themed propaganda massively and attractively to attract many visitors and followers of these accounts. This study reveals that the massive religious lectures with gender bias on social media are not only dealing with the textual understanding of religious texts but also a matter of the religious commodification.

The participants fell into three cultural identity groups: High Bicultural, Moderate Bicultural, and High Arab Cultural. Although all three groups demonstrated positive general family functioning, the Moderate Bicultural group was distinct in that they were less likely to be engaged or married, and they experienced less family support and more family acculturative stressors. The results highlight the importance of the family context in contributing to a stronger sense of cultural identity for young adults who fall at the intersection of Arab and American culture and Muslim faith.},

First, it analyses how various genres of European and American video games have constructed the Arab or Muslim Other. Within these games, it demonstrates how the diverse ethnic and religious identities of the Islamic world have been flattened out and reconstructed into a series of social typologies operating within a broader framework of terrorism and hostility. It then contrasts these broader trends in western digital representation with selected video games produced in the Arab world, whose authors have knowingly subverted and refashioned these stereotypes in two unique and quite different fashions. In conclusion, it considers the significance of western attempts to transcend simplified patterns of representation that have dominated the video game industry by offering what are known as 'serious' games.

Our findings reveal an anti-Muslim online frame, and we detail the ways in which Chinese Muslims have sought to influence public policy in order to protect their rights. The participants in this study responded to hateful posts and worked to increase the understanding of their religion and culture by providing glimpses of their daily lives and by discussing Islam.

	abstract = {The Internet and social media platforms provide a space which qualifies their users to explore them for their various objectives. Muslim women are among the active users who have taken benefit from the rapid development of these digital technologies. Despite the presence of a gender digital divide in some Muslim majority countries, currently, these countries witness the growing presence of women’s voices on the Internet and social media platforms. A digital divide, due to a gap in Internet penetration rate, is evident in many countries. This, however, does not hinder the rise of a digital culture and the participation of Muslim women within it. The Internet and social media platforms have become integral for tech-savvy Muslim women and play diverse roles in their identity construction, not only through the consumption of religion online and their online religious activities. The ability of the Internet to give these women an open and anonymous space has led to the proliferation of diverse cyberactivism expressions ranging from those who use the Internet and social media platforms to voice their concerns regarding gender inequality to those who use it to accentuate their versions of true expressions of Islam. The digital platforms have also led to an increased fragmentation of authority in Islam. Islamic discourses are no longer monopolized by religious elites or ulama, especially male elites. The online environment has boosted the presence of the voices of these women – voices that reflect diverse, segmented, and fragmented Islamic public spheres. © Springer Nature Switzerland {AG} 2021.

Furthermore, a dichotomy emerges within influential messages and contestation; messages discussing Muslims in banal terms as diverse individuals register high levels of agreement, whereas those discussing Islam as a world religion receive more hostility and contestation. © The Author(s) 2020.},

However, we know little about working-class women’s use of social media in Muslim contexts. Using ethnography and interviews, I analyze {TikTok}’s early popularity with working-class women in Pakistan and report three main findings. First, {TikTok}’s initial reception in Pakistan was fractured across class lines; whereas middle-class and elite women dismissed it, working-class women flocked to it, and {TikTok} became associated with a “low-class” femininity. Second, women engaged in a range of gender transgressions on {TikTok}. Third, women simultaneously crafted new practices of “digital purdah,” or veiling, on {TikTok}. I contribute to scholarship on digital purdah by, first, showing how women combine tools available on {TikTok} with other veiling strategies to conceal their identity while expressing their sexuality and second, arguing that “digital purdah” is compatible, rather than incongruous, with gender transgressions on {TikTok}. By showing how co-constituted class and gender dynamics shaped the simultaneous popularity and moral disapproval of {TikTok} in Pakistan, I argue for increased attention to class dynamics in studies of new social media platforms. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Using expert interviews and focus groups, this book investigates the theoretical and practical intersection of misinformation and social media hate in contemporary societies. Social Media and Hate argues that these phenomena, and the extreme violence and discrimination they initiate against targeted groups, are connected to the socio-political contexts, values and behaviours of users of social media platforms such as Facebook, {TikTok}, {ShareChat}, Instagram and {WhatsApp}. The argument moves from a theoretical discussion of the practices and consequences of sectarian hatred, through a methodological evaluation of quantitative and qualitative studies on this topic, to four qualitative case studies of social media hate, and its effects on groups, individuals and wider politics in India, Brazil, Myanmar and the {UK}. The technical, ideological and networked similarities and connections between social media hate against people of African and Asian descent, indigenous communities, Muslims, Dalits, dissenters, feminists, {LGBTQIA} communities, Rohingya and immigrants across the four contexts is highlighted, stressing the need for an equally systematic political response.

The primary attention in this stimulation investigation drives the impulsive buying between the Generation Z of Muslim women customers in Indonesia. This study provides valuable concept to help a company or cosmetic brand grow the marketing strategy for stimulating impulsive behaviour of Generation Z customers on {TikTok} Shop. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey of 256 Muslim women consumers of the Generation Z was used to collect the data. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied to assess the five hypotheses. Findings: The results of this study indicate that micro-celebrities post authenticity has a positive and significant relationship with utilitarian browsing. However, micro-celebrities post authenticity did not have a positive and significant relationship with hedonic browsing. This study also concludes that utilitarian browsing was found to have a positive and significant relationship with hedonic browsing. Finally, hedonic browsing was found to have a positive and significant effect on reminiscence impulse purchase intention and designed impulse purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The primary limitation is the research sample that only consists of Indonesian {TikTok} Shop customers. Next, the researchers could examine the research model in several countries to expand its generalisation. The second one, this research does not consider the origin country of a cosmetic product. The future study must investigate the local and foreign cosmetics to see the preference and the differences in the impulsive purchase, especially for Z women generation customer. Third, this study quantifies the intention to buy impulsively so that the following research must investigate the ownership of the cosmetics product that has been bought before. Finally, the research only involves a quantitative research method. The future study must investigate with another approach, such as a qualitative method or mixed-method, in the impulsive purchase intention context. Practical implications: A cosmetic company or marketer could maximise the authenticity, relevancy and attractive information that is posted by micro media social celebrities or media social influencers. Cosmetic companies or marketers must provide comprehensive information to satisfy customers’ browsing actions. Finally, besides the information related to the limited cosmetics product stock, discount and promotion as the effective strategy to stimulate the impulsive buying, the cosmetics marketing can use gamification, increasing the picture quality and equipping product descriptions, and making educational content. Social implications: The existence of {TikTok} Shop is increasing the number of cosmetics products and competitors because of product’s excessive availability in the market. In the social benefit context, the Generation Z Muslim women can purchase and use various cosmetics product available on {TikTok} Shop, but customers must be on guard by knowing the cosmetics material to prevent the healthiness. In addition, the existence of {TikTok} Shop and the impulsive purchases by the Generation Z Muslim women are also increasing the retailer or local cosmetics producer income. Originality/value: This study is a contribution to consumer behaviour literature by raising the Stimulus–Organism–Response framework used in determining the factors influencing browsing and impulsive consumption of cosmetic products on {TikTok} Shop. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We assess whether the increasing visibility of French hijabi fashion bloggers like these is changing attitudes about the integration of Muslims in France. The media construction of French Muslim identity and its resulting Islamophobia have created an ‘imaginary Islam’ steeped in negativism and racialised stigma, according to some scholars, to which our surveyed influencers respond, manipulating Orientalist tropes to foster ambiguities about religion, sexuality, and race. In drawing attention to dynamic, consumption-based intersections of modest fashion marketing, ‘erasure,’ and processes of meaning-making, we argue that hijabi French Muslim fashion bloggers are increasingly positioning themselves as ‘cyberarbiters’ of social transformation and shifting attitudes about the intersections of Islam, the body, and female sexuality. © 2021 Westburn Publishers Ltd.},

	abstract = {Digital platforms have empowered individuals and communities to re-negotiate long-established notions of religion and authority. A new generation of social media influencers has recently emerged in the Muslim world. They are western-educated, unique storytellers, and savvy in digital media production. This raises new questions on the future of Islam in the context of emerging challenges, such as the openness of technology and the often-perceived closedness of religious and cultural systems within Muslim societies. This paper uses a multiple case research design to examine the roles of social media influencers in reimagining Islam and reshaping spiritual beliefs and religious practices among young people in the Gulf Region, the Arab world, and beyond. We used thematic analysis of the Instagram and {YouTube} content of four social media influencers in the Gulf Region: Salama Mohamed and Khalid Al Ameri from the United Arab Emirates, Ahmad Al-Shugairi from Saudi Arabia, and Omar Farooq from Bahrain. The study found that social media influencers are challenging traditional religious authorities as they reimagine Muslim identities based on a new global lifestyle. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Today, it is challenging to separate online and offline spaces and activities, and this is also true of digital religion as online and offline religious spaces become blended or blurred. With this background, the article explores the need for new typologies of what is religious on the Internet and proposes a conceptual framework for mapping digital religion. Four types of that which is religious on the Internet are presented based on influential classification by Helland. He introduced (1) religion online (sites that provide information without interactivity) and (2) online religion (interactivity and participation). Helland’s concept is developed by, among others, adding two types: (3) innovative religion (new religious movements, cults, etc.) and (4) traditional religion (e.g., Christianity or Islam). Each type is illustrated by selected examples and these are a result of a larger project. The examples are grouped into three areas: (1) religious influencers, (2) online rituals and (3) cyber-religions (parody religions). Additionally, the visual frame for mapping digital religion is presented including the examples mentioned. The presented framework attempts to improve Helland’s classification by considering a more dynamic nature of digital religion. The model is just one possible way for mapping digital religion and thus should be developed further. These and other future research threads are characterized. © 2021 by the author.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the functions of hijab fashion among hijab-wearing women and explore the role of social media and influencers in hijab fashion. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 29 hijab-wearing women in Turkey. The authors collected data in June–November 2020. Findings: Findings show that hijab fashion functions as encouragement, attraction, modesty and social image among Turkish Muslim women. This study also shows that social media and influencers change the meaning of the hijab while promoting hijab fashion. Findings reveal that Instagram boutiques act as digital fashion magazines, which enable women to integrate faster into popular culture today. While influencers have increased the number of hijab-wearing women, they have also turned the hijab into a commodity in the market by degenerating its true meaning. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations regarding the sample and geographic context of consumers. This study may not represent Turkish Muslim women’s behavior as our sample consists of 29 women. Therefore, larger samples are needed to generalize our findings. Undertaking cross-cultural studies will also enable marketers to make cultural comparisons. Practical implications: This study offers some insights for Islamic marketing practitioners in terms of influencer using in hijab fashion. Originality/value: This study adds to the previous research on hijab fashion and hijab consumption on Instagram. This study also extends the previous literature by examining the role of social media and influencers in hijab fashion. Findings revealed that the hijab is gradually losing its spiritual value by becoming a commodity packaged and marketed through Instagram and influencers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

As an influencer, she markets this image of the "modern Muslim woman"to her followers on Instagram, showing them that they too can have a similar life if they consume particular products and perform certain actions. I argue that Cummings has expanded the definition of the "modern Muslim woman"to include a commitment to racial justice, following the Prophetic model of supporting marginalized community. Rather than dismantling the "modern Muslim woman"image, which traditionally excludes Black women, she expands the image to center Black women and Black issues. © 2022 Koninklijke Brill {NV}, Leiden.},

	abstract = {The scale of the representation of the Islamic head covering has increased exponentially over the last decade because of a range of factors, including growth in the modest fashion business sector and increased visibility of Muslim women in hijab in the public space. Social media has played a big role in changing perceptions of the Islamic head covering, via promotion and advertising. Meanwhile, the mainstream fashion industry has included options targeting the modest Muslim female market further, adding to changes in the representation and perception of the hijab. This research will examine the impact of social media and mainstream retail on Australian Muslim women’s perceptions and expressions of hijab. Using interviews and online surveys it explores the links between the fashion industry, social media, and changes in how Muslim women view the hijab. The majority of Australian Muslim women spoken to followed various hijabi bloggers or influencers although only a small proportion adopted recommendations from these hijabi bloggers or influencers (such as purchasing products, or incorporating suggestions on modest clothing or modest style trends). They believed migration, liberalism, social media marketing, and the inclusion of Muslim women in mainstream fashion has contributed to a form of commodification and commercialisation of the hijab. Furthermore, using hijab models as promotional tools to market the products, as well as the use of social media bloggers and influencers to represent them was perceived as tokenistic and disingenuous. © 2022 by the author.},

In recent years, Black American women have curated spaces on social media platforms to authentically converse about Black womanhood and resist structural gendered racism. Still, there is a dearth of research on the subjective importance of Black American women’s social media use and risks for social media addiction. This study tested the association between social media use integration and social media addiction, and whether connectedness to Black women moderated this relationship. Data from 354 Black American women (Mage = 24.34 years) were collected using an online survey. We found that social media use integration was positively associated with social media addiction. Connectedness to Black women moderated this relation, such that the positive association between social media use integration and social media addiction was magnified at a higher level of connectedness to Black women. Our findings inform practice implications for a non-pathologizing approach to addressing social media addiction among Black American women with consideration to structural gendered racist contexts. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Orientalist discourses have largely shaped how Muslim women have come to be represented in western visual media as oppressed, subjugated or foreign. However, with the advent of social media platforms, Muslim women are utilizing social media spaces to rearticulate the controlling images promulgated through orientalist narratives. This article examines the complex relationship visual media shares with Muslim women and demonstrates that the lens of orientalism continues to structure the imaginaries that shape visual representations of Muslim women in art, news and film. This article addresses how visual platforms and social media spaces such as {YouTube} are being utilized by Muslim women to undertake digital activism that seeks to subvert essentialist narratives. At the centre of this discussion is {YouTuber} Dina Tokio’s (2017) documentary, titled ‘\#{YourAverageMuslim}’,  which tackles western preconceived notions, and instead offers a redefined version of the ‘Muslim woman’ predicated on resisting three narratives: (1) Muslim-Woman-As-Oppressed, (2) Muslim-Woman-As-Subjugated and (3) Muslim-Woman-As-Foreign-Other. This documentary clearly demonstrates how Muslim women are using social media platforms in specific ways to shape the discourses around Muslim women. In doing so they are demonstrating their agentic capabilities, taking control of their representations, and speaking for themselves instead of being spoken for by others. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

Research on activism using social media is still nascent, and there are as yet no studies examining the gendered dimensions of social activism on the Internet vis-à-vis the world of work.

Our analysis is grounded in feminist theories of embodiment to theorise the expression of anger in Internet social activism.

Findings suggest women deploy various defensive strategies while navigating online spaces, from normalizing harassment—and taking it for granted—to self-censorship and withdrawal. Interpreting these responses through a feminist lens clarifies the implications for women’s willingness and ability to participate in public spaces and highlights an increased urgency for social media platforms to address and mitigate harassment. © 2020.

	abstract = {The expansion of the Internet and social media has led to growing global interests in enhancing online safety of all categories of users. Nonetheless, the prevalence of online misogyny is worsening across virtual contexts. This study employs online interviews with Nigerian women on Facebook to examine the manifestations, effects, and strategies for navigating online misogyny. Findings reveal that feminism, a budding feature of the Nigerian social media is fast becoming a central motivating factor for online misogyny. Consequently, women’s increasing online engagements are sparking incidents of misogyny that consciously serve to limit their online voices and visibility. Women’s experiences of online misogyny are interrogated as iterative of mainstream patriarchal ideology while muted group theory portraying women’s positioning as a traditionally muted group in mainstream society is deployed to unpack the constructions of misogyny and silencing. Findings challenge common portrayals of social media as gender-neutral environments. Misogynists attack women who adopt feminist tags and those considered pushovers. In response, women adopt a two-tier strategy: “moral persuasion” or “going hard” to deal with online abuse. This approach constitutes serious emotional labour on the part of women and despite its utility, remains unsustainable in fighting online misogyny. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Systematically examining 104 articles, we address three research questions: Which geographical contexts, platforms, and methods do researchers engage with in studies of racism and hate speech on social media? To what extent does scholarship draw on critical race perspectives to interrogate how systemic racism is (re)produced on social media? What are the primary methodological and ethical challenges of the field? The article finds a lack of geographical and platform diversity, an absence of researchers’ reflexive dialogue with their object of study, and little engagement with critical race perspectives to unpack racism on social media. There is a need for more thorough interrogations of how user practices and platform politics co-shape contemporary racisms. © The Author(s) 2020.},

Particularly salient on social media is the lack of rules, etiquette or social taboos around racism controlling what people post and how they express themselves. This allows comments that are blatantly racist and antagonistic rather than concealed and subtle as is more socially acceptable in offline spaces. Using critical discourse analysis, the article will delve into the rhetorical and linguistic strategies the posters use to deny that racism toward Muslims can exist. It will expose how the denial of anti-Muslim racism is used in attempts to silence Muslims and anti-racists as well as to convince the general public that Muslims deserve the ill treatment they receive. However, exposing the strategies of racism deniers gives us a better understanding of how to resist such discourses. © 2022 by the author.},

Drawing on the narratives and expertise of those who have experienced anti-Black racism, this paper employs the theoretical concept of racial dignity to highlight how young African Australians participate in racial discourse on social media. The findings of this paper demonstrate that social media is a significant site where Black African youth reclaim racial dignity through: 1) reversing the white gaze; 2) recognising and calling out anti-blackness; and 3) cultivating and engaging in communities of healing and belonging. Through these digital practices, Black African youth in Australia foster racial agency that promotes positive self-recognition, racial resilience and racial dignity. We argue, therefore, that social media offer Black African young people in Australia spaces to engage in positive expressions of Afro-blackness and challenge anti-blackness in ways that are safer to them than in physical, offline settings in white contexts. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {This article explores the concept of a social media interrupter, one who engages with the visual style and discourse of social media influencers while incorporating a subversive critique of the ways that social media spaces perpetuate injustices and marginalize voices. This concept of social media interrupter is discussed through an analysis of Islamic fashion iconoclast Leah Vernon, a self-identified fat, Black Muslim woman who uses her position as a fashionista on Instagram to insert her biting critique of both Islamic fashion and social media influencers. Instead of standing outside, she interrupts and disrupts Islamic fashion on Instagram by constantly bringing up concerns of body image, fatphobia, colorism, racism, economic inequality, and mental health. Leah’s intersectional feminist critique, I argue, gains power and visibility because of how she effectively interrupts the aesthetic style of Instagram by inserting her unruly body and her concern for social injustices. © 2020 (Kristin M.

Based on the results of three searches, 386 studies were retrieved and coded. Comparisons were made across all {LGB} individuals (138 studies), between {LGB} and heterosexual individuals (65 studies), and between {LGB} females and males (53 studies), with over 500,000 participants. Multiple types of victimization were coded, including discrimination, physical assault, and school victimization. Findings revealed that for {LGB} individuals, reports of victimization experiences were substantial (e.g., 55\% experienced verbal harassment, and 41\% experienced discrimination) and some types have increased since a 1992 review, while others have decreased. {LGB} individuals experienced greater rates of victimization than heterosexual individuals (range: d=.04-.58). {LGB} males experienced some types of victimization more than {LGB} females (e.g., weapon assault and being robbed) but, overall, the gender differences were small. It can be concluded that {LGB} individuals still experience a substantial amount of victimization. Implications for research methods are discussed, including recommendations for sampling and measurement of victimization. [Supplementary materials are available for this article.

Second, cases of harassment impact journalists across multiple levels: individually, interpersonally and professionally. Finally, the participants referred to different ways of coping with what they experienced and identified three sources of support: their peers, their organizations and the public.

Those stories did not only strike the silence that had long hid the perpetrators, but also allowed women to discharge some of their bottled-up grievances, and revealed many important information surrounding sexual harassment. In this paper, we present our analysis of about one million such tweets collected between October 15 and October 31, 2017 that reveals some interesting patterns and attributes of the people, place, emotions, actions, and reactions related to the tweeted stories. Based on our analysis, we also advance the discussion on the potential role of online social media in breaking the silence of women by factoring in the strengths and limitations of these platforms. © Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

However, body positive content is heterogeneous, and the processes underpinning the effects of body positive social media content on body image are not well understood. The aim of this study was to qualitatively examine variations in reactions to different types of body positive images among young people and their perceptions of the underlying processes. A sample of n=33 people, 67\% cisgender women, aged 14–25, mean ({SD}) = 19.6 (2.57) years, were interviewed. Thematic analysis revealed that body positive content highlighting the unrealistic nature of social media and inclusive in its broad portrayals of beauty were evaluated as most helpful. Two main processes were identified: (1) the broadening of understandings of beauty and greater inclusivity; and (2) the modeling of positive body image and active resistance to appearance ideals. However, these effects may vary according to content creators’ characteristics as well as individuals’ own body image concerns and their perceived proximity to those portrayed. Additional work across age, gender, and other identities is warranted to identify the most useful types of content for different individuals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With over a billion users, {YouTube} constitutes almost a third of the online population, and is one of the most used video-sharing sites in the world, becoming a major part of popular culture. A primarily user-generated platform that relies on the creation of video-blogs (vlogs) by content creators (also known as {YouTubers} or vloggers), {YouTube} has been responsible for the development of a new strand of digital professions. Within these professions, vloggers create and market profitable channels, offering an informal learning environment which has given rise to an emerging professional genre of ‘how-to-tutorials’. Of this user-generated content, beauty has become {YouTube}'s most competitive industry, with the publication of over 1.5 million beauty videos in 2015 alone (Pixability, 2015). It is for this reason, that this paper will focus on the digital beauty industry, to investigate the interdiscursive construction of expertise on {YouTube}, specifically the sub-category of beauty how-to-tutorials, drawing on Bhatia's (2008, 2010, 2017) framework of Critical Genre Analysis ({CGA}). Analysis of the data reveals that in the pursuit of establishing themselves as both engaged and interactive participants of the {YouTube} community but also expert and savvy users of {YouTube} keen on building their subscriber base, vloggers discursively exploit the boundaries between the expert and layperson by drawing on their discursive competence, disciplinary knowledge and professional practice (Bhatia, 2017). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

This income is heavily dependent on the distribution of the content and the resulting view counts. Platform owners may exert algorithmic control that impacts content distribution, advertising income, and, consequently, the behaviour of content creators. The objectives of the platform owners combined with the interests of the content creators may lead to paradoxical tensions between the aims of control and autonomy. The opaque nature of algorithms coupled with the need to be recognised by the algorithm further reinforces this phenomenon. This study follows an interpretive qualitative research approach applying grounded theory methodology. This research uses semi-structured interviews with content creators to develop a theory explaining the tension between control and autonomy on revenue-sharing social media platforms. The study shows that algorithmic control and incentivisation create paradoxical tensions that affect the autonomy of content creators. Content creators attempt to minimise tensions of algorithm versus audience, regularity versus scheduling autonomy, and analytics versus decision-making autonomy in two ways: through self-centred measures such as improving metrics, pre-production, and being a pioneer and extraneous measures involving their own businesses, products, and sponsorships. This study sheds some light on the phenomenon of paradoxical tensions and provides guidance and strategies for content creators and platform owners about proceeding with their relationship. This study’s findings provide platform owners and decision-makers with a deeper understanding of the behaviour of content creators and the hurdles they face in platform work. The findings help them identify challenges, draw conclusions, and implement changes. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Spreadable Media maps fundamental changes taking place in our contemporary media environment, a space where corporations no longer tightly control media distribution and many of us are directly involved in the circulation of content. It contrasts "stickiness"-aggregating attention in centralized places-with "spreadability"-dispersing content widely through both formal and informal networks,some approved, many unauthorized. Stickiness has been the measure of success in the broadcast era (and has been carried over to the online world), but "spreadability" describes the ways content travels through social media. Following up on the hugely influential Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, this book challenges some of the prevailing metaphors and frameworks used to describe contemporary media, from biological metaphors like "memes" and "viral" to the concept of "Web 2.0" and the popular notion of "influencers." Spreadable Media examines the nature of audience engagement,the environment of participation, the way appraisal creates value,and the transnational flows at the heart of these phenomena. It delineates the elements that make content more spreadable and highlights emerging media business models built for a world of participatory circulation. The book also explores the internal tensions companies face as they adapt to the new communication reality and argues for the need to shift from "hearing" to "listening" in corporate culture. Drawing on examples from film, music, games, comics, television,transmedia storytelling, advertising, and public relations industries,among others-from both the U.S. and around the world-the authors illustrate the contours of our current media environment. They highlight the vexing questions content creators must tackle and the responsibilities we all face as citizens in a world where many of us regularly circulate media content. Written for any and all of us who actively create and share media content, Spreadable Media provides a clear understanding of how people are spreading ideas and the implications these activities have for business, politics, and everyday life. © 2013 by New York University.

The aim of this research is two-fold: 1. to identify the main uses and gratifications that determine consumers and content creators to use {YouTube}, and 2) to examine the reasons behind the decision to become a content creator on {YouTube}. Based on a qualitative research method, the paper highlights how {YouTube} is used from the perspective of consumers and content creators and the types of needs it gratifies. The research consists of 20 in-depth interviews with {YouTube} consumers and content creators from Romania. While for content consumers {YouTube} is mainly a means of relaxation and information, for content creators this platform becomes a source of recognition and social validation. The study also indicates that vlogging can provide job-specific gratifications. Moreover, the research reveals essential aspects behind the decision to become a content creator. © 2020, National University of Political Studies and Public Administration. All rights reserved.},

Revealing the current social-political context in Western Europe, which is mainly characterized by a growing drift of securitization of Islam and migration, this paper argues that there are two simultaneously running processes regarding the changing nature of Euro-Islam, which seem to are antithetical: individualization of Islam vs. institutionalization of Islam. Drawing upon the findings of the field research in Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, this article shows that while the processes of globalization seem to prompt younger generations with Muslim background to liberate themselves from the constraints of their patriarchal parental and community culture, western states as well as ethnocultural and religious brokers tend to reify, or reinforce, their existing communal and religious boundaries. That is to say that the descendants of migrants seem to have been squeezed between individualization and institutionalization of Islam.},

	abstract = {English Abstract: This paper is located within the discursive and spatio-temporal landscape of post 9/11 Canada in which national identity and beliefs about belonging are embedded in pervasive Islamophobia. Its starting point is that social media are key sites for expression of discrimination and intolerance vis-à-vis people of the Muslim faith, and especially the constitution of Muslim face and head scarves as a metonym for Islamic terrorism and a quintessential symbol of uniquely fundamentalist manifestation of patriarchy. I ask, however, whether new modes of visibility might be captured when we examine representational sites of Muslim femininity through the lens of ‘new’ or ‘critical’ legal pluralism. I highlight how women have used Social Networking Sites ({SNSs}) to respond and reconfigure more entrenched discourses around Muslim femininity circulated elsewhere, such as in formal institutionalized state-based law, mainstream/Western feminist discourses, and in popular cultural productions. I have found that Muslim women deploy social media to constitute or express alternative subjectivities and to represent and evaluate their own understandings of feminism, normative femininity, religious practices, including the multiple meanings that attach to the donning of Islamic headscarves.},

Through interviews with the founder and bloggers of the site and a textual analysis of the blog posts, the author focuses on the aesthetic forms and discursive practices of digital Muslim activism and argues that projects such as Muslimah Media Watch should be evaluated not in terms of a revolutionary subversion of hegemonic discourse on gender in Islam, but rather as part of small but consistent disruptive flows of dissent which are significant precisely because of the nature of their intervention and the tactics of their resistance. The blog has also become a prime discursive and performative space where young Muslims debate and contest what it means to be modern in transnational settings.},

In her posts, Gümüşay complicates the image of Muslim women by denying her own identification with the stereotypical figure of the silent, oppressed Muslima and instead presenting herself as an emancipated female follower of Islam. Moreover, Gümüşay expands the discourse on violence beyond the context of aggression in Islam to include gender and racialized violence. She thus reveals the compatibility of Muslim and feminist identities and creates space for Muslim female activism against violence in the public sphere. Additionally, because of the unique genre of the blog and Gümüşay’s move from alternative to mainstream media, this study focuses on the two-way production of representations, the idea of the blog as a counterpublic, and the longitudinal development of the blog as Gümüşay becomes a public figure.},

Instagram as a social has become a space for Muslim youth all over the world to share images. These images, being circulated over Instagram across localities, create visual representations for other users. For this research, over 500 images with the hashtags \#muslim and \#islam were analysed to understand how Muslims represent themselves and their religion online. A two-step methodological procedure involved the adaption of iconographical and iconological techniques of visual art interpretation to the images collected. The concept of youthfulness and the Islamic concept of deen will be discussed in relation to the analysed images to demonstrate the emergence of a Muslim Instagram. Muslim Instagram is a translocal space that enables Muslims to simultaneously act eternally youthful and cultivate their deen. By playing with notions of youthfulness, Muslims recontextualise their faith and practice online to cultivate their deen. They thereby embed Islam and subsume Islamic concepts and practices into modern global lifestyle patterns of consumption.},

Qualitative Research Using Social Media guides the reader in what different kinds of qualitative research can be applied to social media data. It introduces students, as well as those who are new to the field, to developing and carrying out concrete research projects. The book takes the reader through the stages of choosing data, formulating a research question, and choosing and applying method(s).  Written in a clear and accessible manner with current social media examples throughout, the book provides a step-by-step overview of a range of qualitative methods. These are presented in clear ways to show how to analyze many different types of social media content, including language and visual content such as memes, gifs, photographs, and film clips. Methods examined include critical discourse analysis, content analysis, multimodal analysis, ethnography, and focus groups. Most importantly, the chapters and examples show how to ask the kinds of questions that are relevant for us at this present point in our societies, where social media is highly integrated into how we live. Social media is used for political communication, social activism, as well as commercial activities and mundane everyday things, and it can transform how all these are accomplished and even what they mean.  Drawing on examples from Twitter, Instagram, {YouTube}, {TikTok}, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, Weibo, and others, this book will be suitable for undergraduate students studying social media research courses in media and communications, as well as other humanities such as linguistics and social science-based degrees.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study uses {TikTok} as a novel medium to extend the literature on online activism. It adds to the emergent body of knowledge about playful political participation among youth. It also explores how creative micro-videos can be a force to create momentum and shape opinions around social and political topics. Design/methodology/approach A content analysis of 203 {TikTok} videos reflecting the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict that took place in Sheikh Jarrah in 2021, was used to understand the extent to which {TikTok}’s platform’s affordances were used and examine the message frames that emerged when online users disseminated messages of affect and solidarity with the Palestinians during the Sheikh Jarrah incident. Findings The study showed that {TikTok} affordances encourage virality and creative crafting of direct and indirect political content, making the platform a space for political expression, mobilization, and online activism. The affordances used during the {TikTok} Intifada were visibility, editability, association, and persistence. The two most prominent frames were the use of hashtags to promote the cause, followed by direct political content. Practical implications Researchers are given guidance on how {TikTok} design elements are now allowing a very young segment of users to become producers of political content in a way where messages are creatively crafted using the platform’s affordances. Social implications This study captured social media activism among a young segment of users on a playful platform. Youth are now able to raise awareness and call to action by capitalizing on platform affordances to create and spread content about a cause. Originality/value Using the connective-collective approach, this work adds a unique dimension to the literature on how {TikTok} is becoming a novel space for the emergence of grassroot movements among a very young segment of users and how hard political content has been adapted to fit the playful nature of this dynamic platform. The work also takes lead into studying the Palestinian Intifada in a virtual context, where an unusual activism frame emerged due to the nature of {TikTok} as a micro-video and innovative platform.},

Design/methodology/approach A search for specific criteria and boolean algorithms is carried out in Web of Science and Scopus on «otherness» [{AND}] «social exclusion», to then submit the emerging results to a co-occurrence matrix by citations with {VOSViewer} v. 1.6.13. From the relation tree of the most cited documents [min = 7] of the downloaded articles, a critical/analytical reading is made. Findings «Otherness» is reviewed to a greater extent from a Western perspective, and more specifically, from a Eurocentric one. This implies that the study of «otherness» is not sufficiently analyzed by Asian or African authors, who are excluded from the analysis. In this sense, «otherness» is understood as a theoretical construct and as any symbolic construction of the other (phenotypically, but also in ideology, values and customs), but which carries a load of stereotypes that can become polarization, demonization, ergo and violence. Originality/value Revisiting «otherness» as an informative construct becomes imperative in light of the emergence of extremist groups and xenophobic parties, as well as separatist policies such as Brexit or the Catalan split in Spain. Few articles contribute to elaborating a complete conceptual construct on «otherness» as an epistemological category of communication and information, so this research effort attempts to compile its theoretical discussion.},

Our qualitative content analysis of {TikTok} videos and their related comments demonstrates how users employed {TikTok}’s creative affordances to dissect specific news representations, critique the media apparatus, and expand news narratives.

	abstract = {This exciting volume explores how religious meaning is generated and performed in our present digital media ecosystem. It uses the spatial metaphor of a third space to visualize the mobility of everyday religion and to explore the dynamic ways in which contemporary subjects imagine, produce, and navigate new religious and spiritual places.
Comprised of seven original essays, this book provides a rigorous discussion of the complex intersections of the digital and religion, demonstrating how third spaces of religion stand out by virtue of their in-betweenness. They exist between private and public, between institution and individual, between authority and individual autonomy, between large media framings and individual "pro-sumption," and between local and translocal. Including probing analysis of how Muslim, Catholic, and Neo-Pagan identities are cultivated and developed online, case studies reflect on the creative outcomes of this condition of in-betweenness and the emergence of other places of religious and spiritual meaning.
Blending theoretical analysis with grounded empirical research, this book is essential reading for students and scholars of contemporary religion, media and religion, sociology of religion, religion, and popular culture.},

In Italy, for example, anti-Islamic points of view reiterate the religion’s alleged inconsistency with Catholicism and secularism. This article argues that narrative practices can challenge this idea by articulating Muslim hybrid identities that are compatible with Italian culture and society. The second-generation blog Yalla Italia represents a ‘third space’ where young Italian Muslims contrast dominant media stereotypes, thereby creating ‘disruptive flows of dissent’. A textual analysis of the blog and interviews with some of the bloggers reveal that three main topics are employed to overcome marginalization: (1) critiques of mainstream media (2) narratives about family lives and the practice of Islam, and (3) advocacy of a quicker procedure for gaining Italian citizenship. The bloggers adopt a storytelling style to press for social and institutional change and explain how they succeed in adapting Islam to Italian society. Their religious diversity is thus perceived as providing a potential for Italy, rather than being a mark of marginalization.},

This research’s main objective was to examine how demonization is used as a weapon of oppression to devalue specific individuals through the hashtag \#{StopIslam} and Instagram’s role in this process. The methodology used for this purpose has consisted of an empirical and quantitative analysis of the most recent (1 January 2020–31 July 2020) posts on Instagram with \#{StopIslam}, analyzing the images and the content. The study has determined how, through social media manipulation, erroneous ideas are transmitted that prevent the Islamic collective’s integration, especially in European countries. The conclusions will reflect hate speech and how the Islamic world’s demonization results in the Muslim community’s stigmatization, racism, and Islamophobia. Although there are different articles related to demonization and hate speech, there are not many scientific resources that explain these variables on Instagram and how it affects the inclusion of the Muslim community in Europe, significantly when the time spent on the Internet is growing.},

In this context, social media is a space of opportunity and risk to face discrimination and othering. In this article, we draw upon postcolonial theory and Internet studies to consider {TikTok} affordances as tools that are relevant to understand how cultural, national, and religious identities are shaped and presented in digital spaces. In this sense, this study constitutes the first exploratory analysis of Moroccan-Spanish mixed couples’ (self)representations and identity construction as reflected by their {TikTok} content. The memetic and intersectional aspects of the mixed-couple identity emerge as central in the convergent nature of the platform and their lived experiences. Through an initial analysis of 8,653 {TikTok} videos, we identified 6 creator accounts with more than 10K followers to conduct a deeper multimodal content and discourse analysis of 146 videos. This enabled us to explore how these creators portray their hybrid identity through short, vertical videos harnessing {TikTok}’s vernaculars and affordances. The results enable us to propose the concept of performative hybridization, which involves discursive markers within these couples’ {TikTok} content that reflect a fluid integration of two cultures, while the pervading visual and narrative components reflect the dominance of one set of identity traits over the other. In this case, Moroccan culture is more prevalent.},

Internet memes about religion are defined as, ‘memes circulated on the Internet whose images and texts focus on a variety of religious themes and/or religious traditions’ (Bellar et al., 2013). By drawing on meme genres identified by Shifman (2012) and analyzing techniques used to frame ideas concerning religion in memes, this study identifies common genres found amongst religious Internet meme and core frames used to present messages and assumptions about religion online. This article further draws attention to the importance of studying religion in digital contexts, as it highlights trends, recognized by scholars toward ‘Lived Religion’ within digital culture (Campbell, 2012). Lived Religion argues that contemporary media and digital culture provide important resources for presenting popular beliefs about religion. This study also suggests that studying Internet memes about religion provides a useful lens for understanding popular conceptions about religion within mainstream culture.},

It shows how hijabers employ Instagram as a stage for performing middle-classness, but also for dakwah (“the call, invitation or challenge to Islam”), which they consider one of their primary tasks as Muslims. By enfolding the taking and sharing of images of Muslimah bodies on Instagram into this Quranic imperative, the hijabers shape an Islamic-themed bodily esthetic for middle class women, and at the same time present this bodily esthetic as a form of Islamic knowledge. The article extends work on influencer culture on Instagram, which has considered how and whether women exert control over their bodies in post-feminist performances of female entrepreneurship and consumer choice on social media. In it, we argue that examining the “enframement” of hijaberness on Instagram show it to be both a Muslim variant of post-feminist performances on social media, and a female variant of electronically-mediated Muslim preaching. That is, hijabers’ performances of veiled femininity structure and are structured by two distinct fields-a dynamic global digital culture and a changing field of Islamic communication – and point to a “composite habitus,” similar to that identified by Waltorp. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Geographically dispersed individuals are able to communicate at a speed and cost superior to telephone, mail, and face-to-face meetings. It is important to study the impact of the development of this new mode of communication on human relationships. This paper examines the pattern of on-line interaction among a particular group of Muslim women and the kinds of support they provide on-line. Both participant observation and interviews indicate that members who are socially and geographically isolated and live away from Muslim communities attempt to gain more information and support on-line. These women are among the “active” members and look for more face-to-face and off-line interaction to reduce their feeling of isolation. Other types of support which these Muslim women provide on-line are also explored.La communication en ligne est une nouvelle manière d'établir et d'entretenir des relations humaines. Des individus dispersés au plan géographique peuvent communiquer à une vitesse supérieure et à un coût inférieur par rapport au téléphone, au courrier postal ou aux rencontres directes.

Cet article examine le modèle de l'interaction en ligne dans un groupe donné de femmes musulmanes ainsi que le type de soutien qu'elles offrent en ligne. Des observations participantes ainsi que des entretiens indiquent que des membres qui sont géographiquement et socialement isolés et qui vivent éloignés de communautés musulmanes tentent d'obtenir plus d'information et de soutien en ligne. Ces femmes sont parmi les membres “actifs” et recherchent plus de rencontres directes et une interaction “offline” pour réduire leur sentiment d'isolement.

Twenty-one hijabers’ self-portraits were examined through a digital ethnographic method that used semistructured face-to-face interviews and participant observations at various hijabers’ community events in Indonesia. Findings reveal that “being the real me” is the hijabers’ claim to project their self-portrait authenticity. This claim is shaped by Indonesian social norms and Islamic values. The hijabers are curating a version of authenticity that is designed to be culturally acceptable. Therefore, this study provides a new understanding of how Indonesian hijabers’ negotiation of authenticity on Instagram is subjected to a collectivistic culture.},

Despite the increased importance of social media in the (re)production of discursive power in society, this is the first study of its kind. The analysis shows that Muslims are portrayed in the forum as a homogeneous outgroup that is embroiled in conflict, violence and extremism: characteristics that are described as emanating from Islam as a religion. These patterns are strikingly similar to – but often more extreme versions of – those previously found in analysis of traditional media. This indicates that, in this case, the internet forum seems to serve as an “online amplifier” that reflects and reinforces existing discourses in traditional media, which is likely to result in even stronger polarizing effects on public discourses.},

	abstract = {Für die vorliegende Studie wurden christliche Online-Medien in Bezug auf ihre Berichterstattung zu Islam und Muslim*innen, insbesondere aber deren Anknüpfung an islamfeindliche und rassistische Diskurse untersucht. Dazu wurden  über 1000 Artikel evangelisch- und katholisch-konfessioneller Online-Medien, Zeitschriften und Gemeindeblätter aus dem Zeitraum 2015-2022 einer qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse unterzogen. Auf dieser Grundlage konnten übergreifende Islambilder und wiederkehrende Muster einer perspektivisch-christlichen Berichterstattung identifiziert werden, mit denen in unterschiedlicher Intensität antimuslimischer Rassismus (re)produziert wird. 
Die Untersuchung zeigt, dass über Islam und Muslim*innen vor allem in problemzentrierter Berichterstattung und mittels Techniken wie dem Othering gesprochen wird. Darüber hinaus werden spezifisch christliche Diskursformationen analysiert, die vor allem durch Themenkonjunkturen wie „Christenverfolgung“ oder einem „christzentrischen“ Blick auf Islam entstehen. Die Studie zeigt wie dieses selbstreferenzielle Sprechen über den Islam und Muslim*innen vielfach mit Selbstaufwertungen und kulturalisierenden Zuschreibungen einhergeht. Dadurch findet sich antimuslimischer Rassismus nicht nur im „rechten Christentum“ und verschwörungstheoretischen Deutungsmustern, sondern medien- und konfessionsübergreifend wieder.
Die Studie wurde vom Bundesministerium des Innern und für Heimat in Auftrag gegeben und diente dem Unabhängigen Expertenkreis Muslimfeindlichkeit als externe Expertise für seinen Bericht „Muslimfeindlichkeit – Eine deutsche Bilanz“ (vgl. https://www.deutsche-islam-konferenz.de/{DE}/Startseite/startseite\_node.html).},

	abstract = {Against the backdrop of the widespread individualization of the creative workforce, various genres of social media production have emerged from the traditionally feminine domains of fashion, beauty, domesticity, and craft. Fashion blogging, in particular, is considered one of the most commercially successful and publicly visible forms of digital cultural production. To explore how fashion bloggers represent their branded personae as enterprising feminine subjects, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the textual (n?=?38 author narratives) and visual (n?=?760 Instagram images) content published by leading fashion bloggers; we supplement this with in-depth interviews with eight full-time fashion/beauty bloggers. Through this data, we show how top-ranked bloggers depict the ideal of ?having it all? through three interrelated tropes: the destiny of passionate work, staging the glam life, and carefully curated social sharing. Together, these tropes articulate a form of entrepreneurial femininity that draws upon post-feminist sensibilities and the contemporary logic of self-branding. We argue, however, that this socially mediated version of self-enterprise obscures the labor, discipline, and capital necessary to emulate these standards, while deploying the unshakable myth that women should work through and for consumption. We conclude by addressing how these findings are symptomatic of a digital media economy marked by the persistence of social inequalities of gender, race, class, and more.},

Despite the importance of {TikTok}'s algorithm to the platform's success and content distribution, little work has been done on the empirical analysis of the algorithm. Our work lays the foundation to fill this research gap. Using a sock-puppet audit methodology with a custom algorithm developed by us, we tested and analysed the effect of the language and location used to access {TikTok}, follow- and like-feature, as well as how the recommended content changes as a user watches certain posts longer than others. We provide evidence that all the tested factors influence the content recommended to {TikTok} users. Further, we identified that the follow-feature has the strongest influence, followed by the like-feature and video view rate. We also discuss the implications of our findings in the context of the formation of filter bubbles on {TikTok} and the proliferation of problematic content.},

The “secret weapon” is its unique methodology of discovering and delivering content. On the “For You” feed, {TikTok} mixes videos of both internet celebrities and newcomers, encourages high-quality creative content according to page views, and promotes new bloggers to share videos with users. The unique aspect is that anyone has the opportunity to spring into fame on the feed. Through {TikTok}'s recommendation algorithm, videos are continuously recommended to users with similar interests or attributes as video bloggers, thus allowing high-quality creative content to be disseminated quickly. The {TikTok} recommendation algorithm does not take video blogger's fanbase or popularity into major consideration. In addition to the candidate video title, audio, and tags, the algorithm integrates the content of the user's uploaded videos, and the categories of videos liked by the user. {TikTok}'s skills at enhancing user loyalty are impressive, which can not only accurately recommend videos of interest to users, but also assist them in expanding into new intersecting areas.①①Original source in Chinese: M.

	abstract = {Third spaces have been imagined as sites of resistance, where hegemonic and normative understandings of the world may be challenged. New media are often imagined to have this liberatory potential as well, particularly for those individuals who experience social, cultural, or political marginalization. This research considers whether social media might help facilitate third spaces. It takes as a case for exploring this topic the experience of 188 Muslim bloggers in social networking site Tumblr. Many of these individuals live in non-Muslim majority countries and say they sometimes feel stuck between identities. The qualitative analysis of their blogs, as well as interviews with 30 of the bloggers, seeks to understand how Tumblr can facilitate third spaces where these bloggers can explore the hybrid nature of their identities while connecting to others who share that experience.},

Together, these stories span a vast cultural and geographic landscape, including Indonesia, Iran, the Middle East, and the United States. These case studies are contextualized within the backdrop of broader social trends, including racism and Islamophobia, gender dynamics, celebrity culture, identity politics, and the shifting dynamics of contemporary religious piety and practice. Authors examine a wide-range of digital multimedia technologies as primary ''texts." These include websites, podcasts, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, {YouTube} channels, online magazines and discussion forums, and religious apps. The book's contributors draw on the methodological and theoretical models of multiple academic disciplines, including Religious Studies, Cultural Anthropology, Global Studies, Communication and Media Studies, Religious Studies, and Islamic Studies"--},

	abstract = {"Digital Femininities: The Gendered Construction of Cultural and Political Identities Online examines the role of new media technologies in the production of girls' cultural and political identities. The book argues that the varied and complex spaces which make up our 'social media' should be conceptualised as important terrains upon which neoliberal and postfeminist subjectivities can be both reproduced and subverted. In doing so, the book explores many key issues underpinning current debates around gender politics and digital media, including gendered spatial politics, visibility, surveillance and regulation, beauty politics, and civic and political engagement and activism. Over the last decade, the position of girls and young women within the digital landscape of social media has been a topic of much debate. On the one hand, girls' social media practices are presented as a key site of concern, wherein new digital technologies are said to have produced an intensification of individualized, neoliberal and postfeminist identities. Conversely, others have championed access to social media for young people as a potentially revolutionary political tool, enabling previously marginalized political subjects (such as girls) to access and participate within new and exciting political cultures. Locating itself at the intersection of these two approaches, this book offers a fresh contribution to these debates. Based upon the findings from focus groups with girls and young women aged between 12 and 18 in England, the book offers an in-depth analysis of the digital cultures that emerged from the study. This timely book will be essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary femininity and feminism and the role of digital media in the production of cultural, political and gendered identities"--},

	abstract = {Das Erstarken rechtspopulistischer Bewegungen führt zu einer Normverschiebung in europäischen Gesellschaften und erzeugt Spannungen, die sich in Polarisierung widerspiegeln. Es geht dabei weniger um Migration selbst als um die Prozesse, die stattfinden, wenn Migrant*innen und ihre Nachkommen ihre Rechte einfordern. Die Frage des Umgangs mit Migration wird so zur Chiffre für Anerkennung von Gleichheit in demokratischen Gesellschaften. Naika Foroutan zeigt, dass die Migrationsfrage zur neuen sozialen Frage geworden ist - an ihr werden Verteilungsgerechtigkeit und kulturelle Selbstbeschreibung ebenso wie die demokratische Verfasstheit verhandelt. "Wie hältst Du es mit der Migration?" steht für die Frage danach, was ausgehandelt werden muss, damit die plurale Demokratie zusammenhält. Die postmigrantische Gesellschaft ist also eine, die sich im Kontext der Debatten um den Stellenwert von Migration neu ordnet. „Auch wenn die drei Komplexe ("Anerkennung und Aushandlung“, „Ambivalenzen und Ambiguitäten“, „Antagonisten und Allianzen"), anhand derer die Autorin ihren Begriff von der „postmigrantischen Gesellschaft“ entfaltet, nicht die gleiche Wirkmacht entwickeln wie Langhoffs Begriff – als Blick hinter die Kulissen der Diskurse ist das genaue Buch informativ für eine akademisch geübte Leserschaft“ (deutschlandfunkkultur.de)},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on embodiment as enacted and expressed on websites and blogs produced or populated by Muslim women. While there is no agreement amongst scholars and believers in different schools of Islam whether Muslim women are required to wear the headscarf, it is acknowledged that Muslim dresscode should be guided by the principle of modesty. Modest dress in Islam is understood in different ways, from all-concealing garments such as the burqa, to long-sleeved tops and long skirts or tunics obscuring body shape, all available to purchase online. This variety is reflected in material published by Muslim women on the Internet who construct their online identity by writing but also by posting their pictures on sites such as Facebook, {YouTube}, Muslim or Islamic dating websites. According to some interpretations, depictions of human bodies should not be published and Muslim women advocating this position choose to use photos of still nature or abstract works of art as their avatars. Imagery on the websites is a useful springboard into considering the nature of online identity, therefore a range of Muslim women's profiles on social networks as well a number of websites and blogs are analysed using interdisciplinary methods (visual and discourse analysis). Muslim women's representations of themselves often contrast with their representations produced by the media; it is argued that the latter are negative and biased (Afshar, 1998, 2008), hence it is imperative to address the ways in which Muslim women speak about themselves in not only textual, but also visual modes.},

	abstract = {[One of the most serious challenges which is still threatening Muslims globally is the surge in Islamophobia, or negative attitudes and excessive fear towards Islam and Muslims. The digital age became a double-edged sword when it comes to the threat of Islamophobia. On one hand, it opened the door for anti-Muslim campaigns to spread widely and quickly online. On the other hand, it provided modern Muslims with much-needed opportunities to resist such hateful campaigns using the very same digital tools. This article sheds light on three important strategies which have been successfully deployed by modern Muslims to resist Islamophobia in the digital age. The first is the effective utilization of humor to resist some of the most hateful anti-Muslim campaigns and misrepresentations in cyberspace and present successful counternarratives. The second is putting faith in action, through Muslim philanthropy and communal giving, especially amid the {COVID}-19 pandemic. This has been done by using digital tools to spread and amplify these good deeds, while resisting Islamophobia simultaneously by correcting some of the false images and skewed misrepresentations about Islam and Muslims and replacing them with positive ones. And the third is boosting the visibility of Muslim women’s identities and amplifying their voices, which shatters the negative stereotypes about Muslim women as silent and helpless beings and counters their misrepresentation and marginalization, while countering Islamophobia in parallel. In discussing each of these strategies, the appropriate context is explained and relevant examples are provided to illustrate the arguments made throughout this paper.]},

Focusing on Charli D’Amelio, this essay argues that the increasing visibility of {TikTok} and rising celebrity of D’Amelio during the Coronavirus crisis continues and intensifies the longer history of young female celebrity culture, and obscures the dangers and impacts faced by girls around the world who are situated outside of the ideals embodied in {TikTok} stars like D’Amelio.},

This phenomenon of digital transformation introduced a myriad of positive, negative, and paradoxical impacts. This critical essay tackles some of the significant transformations and paradoxes which the introduction of the internet invited in modern Muslim societies, with a special focus on two specific domains. First, the realm of religious authority or obtaining authoritative religious knowledge in the age of the internet. Second, the realm of shifting gendered Islamic identities in the age of cyberspace. In exploring these complex and hybrid phenomena, special attention is paid to the tensions between the opposing forces of tradition and modernity, diversity and cohesion, hegemony and resistance, and globalization and localization in cyberspace, and their numerous and far-reaching effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract: What is the relationship between Islamic principles of modesty and practices of aesthetic labor in the industries of influencer marketing and fashion? I respond to this question by examining the aesthetic labor of self-proclaimed modest Muslim female social media influencers to show how Islamic modesty—as it is understood via patriarchal interpretations of Islamic texts, and by cultural authorities in secular circles of fashion, is deemed inherently antithetical to Muslim female aesthetic labor in the fashion and influencer marketing industries. My findings show that Muslimah influencers face a doubly burdened challenge: on the one hand, Muslim women are expected to modify their performances of modesty to align with the secular expectations of aesthetic labor in these industries, but on the other, they are expected to observe modesty according to patriarchal interpretations of Islamic texts. In either case, failure to abide by racialized and gendered expectations renders Muslim women vulnerable to critique from Muslim and non-Muslim communities. I argue that this conflict illustrates that Islamic modesty is deemed fundamental to contemporary conceptions and embodied performances of Muslim womanhood online and plays a key role in shaping racialized and gendered expectations of Muslim women held by Muslim and non-Muslim communities in the west.},

Drawing on critical studies of identity, behaviour and representation, Identity and Digital Communication demonstrates how identity is shaped and understood in the context of significant and ongoing shifts in online communication. Chapters cover a range of topics including advances in social networking, the development of deepfake videos, intimacies of everyday communication, the emergence of cultures based on algorithms, the authenticities of {TikTok}, and online communication's setting as a site for hostility and hate speech. Throughout the text, author Rob Cover shows how the formation and curation of self-identity is increasingly performed and engaged with through digital cultural practices, affirming that these practices must be understood if we are to make sense of identity in the 2020s and beyond. Featuring critical accounts, everyday examples, and analysis of key platforms such as {TikTok}, this textbook is an essential primer for scholars and students in media studies, psychology, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, computer science, as well as health practitioners, mental health advocates and community members"},

Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews, this book provides an original and timely insight into the development of the manosphere, how and why people join and self-identify as incel, the extent to which the influence and philosophy of incel and the incelsphere draws on and is penetrating mainstream culture and political discourse, and its harmful impact. The Incel Rebellion is essential reading for a broad range of practitioners and scholars across criminology, sociology, terrorism studies, gender, media and cultural studies, and politics, as well as expanding the field of cybercrime research and beyond"--Page 4 of cover},

Applying a multimodal analysis to 500 {TikTok} videos posted during the conflict under \#gazaunderattack, we identify three memetic templates (\#challenge)?(1) lip-syncing, (2) duets, and (3) point-of-view?that unfold the ways {TikTok}?s design and its play-based affordances ignite affective streams of audiovisual content that render playful activism in times of conflict. Driven by {TikTok}?s culture of imitation and competition, playful activism enables the participation of ordinary users in political emerging events with the help of looping meme videos composed of collaborative, dialogic, and communal socio-technical functions. Playful activism transforms users? ritualized performances into powerful political instruments on {TikTok} and makes democratic participation more relatable, tangible, and accessible to various audiences.},

On the basis of quantitative data, the article outlines the significant correlations found between respondents’ degrees of personal religiosity, frequency of religious practice, and levels of internet use for religion-related purposes. On the basis of qualitative data, the article then moves to explore how concerns about the trustworthiness of online content and the continuing influence of offline religious authorities work to shape and inform the online religious engagements of our Turkish and Israeli Muslim young adult respondents.},

While many aspects of these developments have been described theoretically and empirically, little is known about the dynamic interplay between digital media use, an individual’s religious meaning system, and the relationships within a religious community. Building on the theory of the mediatization of religion, the functionalist perspective of religion, media selection, and co-orientation research, we propose a dynamic model of digital media use in religious communities. Hereby, the religious functions of meaning-making and social connection are considered important drivers for how individuals engage with others. Additionally, theories on media selection help our understanding of the acceptance and domestication of new technologies, as well as selective exposure to specific content. In combination, the model links the individuals with the social context of their religious communities and vice versa. Furthermore, the theoretical model helps to combine and systematize empirical research from different disciplines that are relevant to understanding today’s digital religious media use. We therefore conclude with a discussion of the benefits of the model for future theoretical developments and empirical research in the field of digital religion and beyond.},

              Since the early 1990s, religious movements appeared on the Internet and introduced new forms of communication in ritual and dogma. Their Internet sites present different dogmatic, institutional, and other aspects of their religion; provide interactive communications and religious services; or simply sell religious items. This paper puts forth the argument that the gaining of ritual and dogmatic knowledge is losing its dependence on direct social interaction in a spatial community, and increasingly relies on Internet-based discourse in religious newsgroups and other discussion forums. Nevertheless, for migrant communities in the diaspora (Zoroastrians, Hindus, and adherents of Afro-American religions), the Internet appears to be offering a new opportunity for re-establishing the spatial bonds of the lost religious community. In other cases such as that of the Wicca religion, this greater independence of traditional religious and social hierarchies encourages the development of fragmentary and syncretic forms of religion.},

This phenomenon of digital transformation introduced a myriad of positive, negative, and paradoxical impacts. This critical essay tackles some of the significant transformations and paradoxes which the introduction of the internet invited in modern Muslim societies, with a special focus on two specific domains. First, the realm of religious authority or obtaining authoritative religious knowledge in the age of the internet. Second, the realm of shifting gendered Islamic identities in the age of cyberspace. In exploring these complex and hybrid phenomena, special attention is paid to the tensions between the opposing forces of tradition and modernity, diversity and cohesion, hegemony and resistance, and globalization and localization in cyberspace, and their numerous and far-reaching effects.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;Radicalization and violent extremism are pressing problems across the world. After initially addressing problems in defining radicalization and extremism, this article sketches a new social-developmental model based on a systematic integration of theories and empirical findings. We propose a three-step model of radicalization starting with ontogenetic social-developmental processes during the most dynamic period for social development, from early childhood to late adolescence. These processes include the interaction of societal, social, and individual risk and protective factors. In adverse cases this interplay encourages the establishment of proximal radicalization processes between early adolescence and middle adulthood. We assume that four interrelated but distinct social-developmental processes are central conditions for radicalization and extremism: identity problems, prejudice, political or religious ideologies, and antisocial attitudes and behavior. These proximal processes are triggered by actual societal, social, or individual conflicts (such as economic crisis, victimization) and marked by continuous intergroup processes. The more intense the proximal processes, the greater the likelihood of extremist attitudes and behavior. The article closes by discussing implications for early prevention and an outlook for further research.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

This study examines the effects of religious and political factors on views of politically motivated violence ({PMV}). We draw from diverse scholarship, emphasizing arguments that are inspired by Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilizations perspective, as well as recent work in the sociology of Islam. Using a measure that gauges support for "suicide bombing" from the 2007 Pew Survey of American Muslims, results from logistic regression models suggest that political views and religious factors have a minimal effect on Muslim American attitudes toward suicide bombing. Furthermore, we find that Qur'\&\#xe4;nic authoritativeness (i.e., the view that the Qur'\&\#x101;n is the word of God and not written by men) is associated with lower odds of supporting this form of {PMV}. We discuss the implications of our findings for the often anecdotal and alarmist accounts that link Muslim religiosity to support for "radical" extremism.

We used multivariate linear regression to assess the association between scores on the Radical Intentions Scale ({RIS}) with demographic characteristics, anxiety, depression, social support, and discrimination.Results: In the full sample, discrimination, age, and gender were associated with {RIS} scores. When we examined moderation effects by location, {RIS} scores were associated with depression only in Montréal, and with social support (negatively) and discrimination in Toronto. None of the variables were significant in Boston.Conclusion: These findings suggest that an understanding of risk and protective factors for support of {VR} may be context-dependent.

Previous research has shown that {EH} has a negative impact on the health, well-being, and integration of immigrants. However, little is known about which immigrants are more likely to experience {EH}. This study aims to fill this gap. We develop a theoretical framework for understanding {EH} and use it to generate hypotheses about individual-level characteristics. We test these hypotheses using data from the Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey and analyze the experiences of {EH} among 12,596 immigrants in 17 European countries. Largely in line with theoretical expectations, results from logistic regression models reveal that immigrants are more likely to experience {EH} if they are Muslim, wear religious clothing, are from the second generation, are higher educated, are proficient in the host-country language, and perceive themselves to be overqualified for their job and face more economic hardship.},

            What is the impact of this on societies, believers, and understandings of Islam? Islamic Algorithms provides a thorough exploration of cyber Islamic environments ({CIEs}) through representations of significant historical and religious influences across contexts and diversities. This ranges from jinn and angels through to contemporary influencers. Influence is built and developed across and within categories of interpretation, context, origins, and historical patterns - from the emergence of the Qur'an through to Islamic expansion in space and time. This includes the power dynamics of {CIEs}, incorporating a range of specific influences and ideas explored in Allah Algorithms. Religious authority and influence take multifarious forms, with underlying archetypal patterns that can relate to context and combinations of other factors and influences - traditional, historical, legalistic, cultural, genealogical, linguistic, interpretative and, in contemporary contexts - technological.
            Islamic Algorithms raises issues of how digital content is embedded in contemporary understandings of Islam and their dissemination. Gary Bunt shows how perceptions of pivotal figures in Islam are informed by new generations of digital influences, which present a primary source of information and dissemination within younger Muslim demographics, with user expectations commensurate with other areas of online expression – such as apps, interactivity, and peer networking.},

White British Muslims perceive their ethnic and religious identities to be (mis/not) recognized in complex and contradictory ways. Their identities are affirmed, denied, erased, and/or incorrectly ascribed, sometimes simultaneously, by relevant others in different contexts. Performative strategies such as the adoption, maintenance, or removal of identity markers are used consciously and agentically in attempts to take back control over how their identities are (mis/not) recognized. At times deliberate performative acts leading to misrecognition are orchestrated by white Muslims themselves to not only minimize the risk of experiencing possible harm or marginalization but also to transgress and challenge norms. They also assert their multiple identities as a response to (mis/non)recognition and claims of their identities being incompatible, regardless of the repercussions that may result in them being placed at the margins of, or excluded from, their ingroups.},

This paper puts forth the argument that the gaining of ritual and dogmatic knowledge is losing its dependence on direct social interaction in a spatial community, and increasingly relies on Internet-based discourse in religious newsgroups and other discussion forums. Nevertheless, for migrant communities in the diaspora (Zoroastrians, Hindus, and adherents of Afro-American religions), the Internet appears to be offering a new opportunity for re-establishing the spatial bonds of the lost religious community. In other cases such as that of the Wicca religion, this greater independence of traditional religious and social hierarchies encourages the development of fragmentary and syncretic forms of religion.]},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This research explores the intricate relationship between fashion, identity and religion in Muslim hijabi fashion. More specifically, it examines the impact of global brands’ inclusion of Muslim veiled females in their fashion lines.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Employing a qualitative approach, the research involved 20 in-depth interviews with Muslim women who wear hijab and those who dress modestly without it. Participants were chosen through judgemental sampling, focusing on individuals interested in fashion and brand trends. The study investigated perceptions of brand strategies, the role of influencers and consumer responses within this context.
            
            
              Findings
              The research suggests consumers have different viewpoints about these brands that are compliant with hijabi fashion. This incorporation benefits Muslim women by enhancing their status and recognition, hence fostering the growth of the Muslim fashion industry. In Western society, it promotes a sense of belonging and individuality. Certain individuals see the exploitation of their religious affiliation for financial gain, thereby raising doubts about these companies’ comprehension of Islamic modesty. This has engendered a sense of distrust and suspicion.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This research illuminates the intricate connection between religion, fashion and market dynamics in the realm of Muslim hijabi fashion. This paper explores the multifaceted responses of Muslim women to the marketing methods used by global fashion designers, which include a delicate balance between cultural representation and commercial exploitation. The results shed light on the ways in which fashion both empowers and creates divisions among religious and cultural groups.},

            Eschewing the notion that people’s spirituality and their bodily materiality are in binary opposition, this chapter examines how people engage their material bodies in their religious and spiritual practices. Rather than looking at the practices of religious institutions, it asks: What might we see differently if we focused on the ordinary, everyday embodied practices by which people, individually and collectively, literally live their religions? Bodies (e.g., senses, postures, gestures, and voices) are at the very core of individual religious experience, as well as at the center of shared religious expression and community. Examples of specific embodied practices in gardening and dancing suggest how many contemporary patterns of lived religion involve embodied practices.},

	abstract = {At once historically and theoretically informed, these essays invite the reader to think of religion dynamically, reconsidering American religious history in terms of practices that are linked to specific social contexts. The point of departure is the concept of "lived religion." Discussing such topics as gift exchange,
cremation, hymn-singing, and women's spirituality, a group of
leading sociologists and historians of religion explore the many
facets of how people carry out their religious beliefs on a daily basis. As David Hall notes in his introduction, a history of
practices "encompasses the tensions, the ongoing struggle of
definition, that are constituted within every religious tradition and that are always present in how people choose to act. Practice thus suggests that any synthesis is provisional." The volume opens with two essays by Robert Orsi and Danièle Hervieu-Léger that offer an overview of the rapidly growing study of lived religion, with
Hervieu-Léger using the Catholic charismatic renewal movement in
France as a window through which to explore the coexistence of
regulation and spontaneity within religious practice. Anne S. Brown and David D. Hall examine family strategies and church membership in early New England. Leigh Eric Schmidt looks at the complex
meanings of gift-giving in America. Stephen Prothero writes about the cremation movement in the late nineteenth century. In an essay on the narrative structure of Mrs. Cowman's {\textless}em{\textgreater}Streams in the
Desert{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, Cheryl Forbes considers the devotional lives of
everyday women. Michael {McNally} uses the practice of hymn-singing among the Ojibwa to reexamine the categories of native and
Christian religion. In essays centering on domestic life, Rebecca Kneale Gould investigates modern homesteading as lived religion
while R. Marie Griffith treats home-oriented spirituality in the
Women's Aglow Fellowship. In "Golden- Rule Christianity," Nancy
Ammerman talks about lived religion in the American mainstream.},

examines religious practices wherever they happen-both within
religious spaces and in everyday life. Although the study of lived religion has been around for over two decades, there has not been an agreed-upon definition of what it encompasses, and we have
lacked a sociological theory to frame the way it is studied. This book offers a definition that expands lived religion's geographic scope and a framework of seven dimensions around which we can
analyze lived religious practice. Examples from multiple traditions and disciplines show the range of methods available for such
studies, offering practical tips for how to begin. The volume opens up how we understand the category of lived religion, erasing the
artificial divide between what happens in congregations and other religious institutions and what happens in other settings. Nancy
Tatom Ammerman draws on examples ranging from Singapore to Accra to Chicago to show how deeply religion permeates everyday lives. In
revealing the often overlooked ways that religion shapes human
experience, she invites us all into new ways of seeing the world
around us.},

For minority groups, these strategies can be used to negotiate religion and create a different image. This study shows that both Christian and Muslim youth with minority backgrounds use different strategies to present their religiosity. Even though all the informants want to portray themselves as religious, they carefully consider what type of religious content they share to avoid social exclusion, conflict and religious discussions.},

            Life at the beginning of the 21st century is something the social theory of the last century would have found hard to explain. Science, capitalism, and politics are pervasive and powerful in the everyday lives of ever-expanding layers of the world’s population. But so is religion. This book is an attempt to let “everyday religion” raise critical questions about how we understand the role of religion in society. We take pluralism and choice as givens, for instance, but we find “rational choice” theories too thin to explain the religious expressions we document. We look for religion in both “private” and “public” spaces, and ask about the social circumstances of religion’s presence and absence. In the end, we find that no simple theory of secularization or revival can explain how modern religious lives unfold.},

in general have been marginalized and represented with all sorts of images in
the media. Specifically, when it comes to how muslim women are pictured
especially in the western media, there have been different portrayals that
researchers have come across during their multitudes of research studies. The
present study is another addition to the already available literature on how
muslim women are portrayed in the western media by content analyzing the
portrayals in the New York times and the Guardian of the United Kingdom. In
particular, the study seeks to examine the ways in which Muslim Women are portrayed
in the New York Times and the Guardian’s news coverage as well as determining
the frames that the two news organizations use in portraying Muslim women in
coverage of their news stories regarding their affairs. The study adopted a
qualitative content analysis and uses the framing theory to guide the discovery
of the findings. 49 stories portraying muslim women in the different ways were discovered
after perusing through the two online news organizations. The findings of the
study indicate that muslim women in the two sampled news media are portrayed as
terrorists specifically because of their dress code where on several occasions
the news organizations refer to them as Al-Qaida’s and extremists in the way
they practice their religion. Therefore, the major portrayal of muslim women
lies on the negative aspects that are reported in the organization’s media
stories. In addition, among the dominant themes in the two news media regarding
the way the frame their stories while reporting on muslim women include being financially
oppressed, terrorists, extremists, un educated, house wives and sexual objects
for men. In the end, framing theory is also supported in the study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In her article Going on Pilgrimage Online. The Representation of Shia Rituals on the Internet, Sabine Kalinock gives an overview of the representation of Shia ritual in the Internet and discusses the relation between innovations and traditional discourses. Emphasis is laid on the possibilities that the Internet offers and which are especially important in the Muslim and Iranian context: the mixing of the sexes, exchange with believers in other parts of the world and the free expression of critical ideas. Kalinock thereby concentrates on case studies from Iranian religious websites set up by various Shiite communities, official institutions as well as private persons. These Websites are usually presented in at least three languages: Arab, Persian, and English, and deal with religious regulations and rituals, hagiographies and recent miracle stories that are recorded with modern technology and confirmed by physicians. Pictures, video films and audio records supplement the texts. Via email believers can seek the guidance of a leading clergyman of their choice (marja at-taqlid) while various books and online resources provide further advice. In chat rooms men and women discuss, affirm or question the meaning and validity of certain religious rules and rituals.},

	abstract = {In traditional societies, knowledge is organized in hierarchical chains through which authority is legitimated by custom. Because the majority of the population is illiterate, sacred knowledge is conveyed orally and ritualistically, but the ultimate source of religious authority is typically invested in the Book. The hadith (sayings and customs of the Prophet) are a good example of traditional practice. These chains of Islamic knowledge were also characteristically local, consensual and lay, unlike in Christianity, with its emergent ecclesiastical bureaucracies, episcopal structures and ordained priests. In one sense, Islam has no church. While there are important institutional differences between the world religions, network society opens up significant challenges to traditional authority, rapidly increasing the flow of religious knowledge and commodities. With global flows of knowledge on the Internet, power is no longer embodied and the person is simply a switchpoint in the information flow. The logic of networking is that control cannot be concentrated for long at any single point in the system; knowledge, which is by definition only temporary, is democratically produced at an infinite number of sites. In this Andy Warhol world, every human can, in principle, have their own site. While the Chinese Communist Party and several Middle Eastern states attempt to control this flow, their efforts are only partially successful. The result is that traditional forms of religious authority are constantly disrupted and challenged, but at the same time the Internet creates new opportunities for evangelism, religious instruction and piety. The outcome of these processes is, however, unknown and unknowable. There is a need, therefore, to invent a new theory of authority that is post-Weberian in reconstructing the conventional format of charisma, tradition and legal rationalism.},

Some questions are still open for inquiry: What can a material approach contribute to the understanding of religious authority in digital venues? How can authority be materially displayed on the Internet? This article shows how religious authority is affected by material practices connected with digital media use through the qualitative analysis of a Neo-Pagan forum, The Celtic Connection. Neo-Pagans tend to hold a non-traditional notion of authority, accord great importance to material practices, and extensively use the Internet. The analysis of the forum suggests that Neo-Pagans use digital venues to look for informal sources of authority and strategies to embed materiality in online narratives. The article claims that it is important to develop new frameworks to analyze non-traditional authority figures and new definitions of media that include both physical objects and communication technologies.},

	abstract = {The relationship between media and religion seems to be a well established research topic today. Themes like identity formation and community with regard to digital religion are well researched, but religious authority is pointed out as an area that needs more detailed investigation. Although the topic of authority has been of interest to scholars and practitioners, religious authority received less attention and systematic analysis. Therefore, this article considers the interplay between media and religion by highlighting the possible implications for religious authority when religion is mediated specifically through technology. To illustrate the possible implications for religious authority in a context where religion is mediated through technology, this article will identify certain shifts that took place with regard to religion. In the light of the identified changes with regard to religion, the article will attempt to specifically explore and identify the possible implications for religious authority. At least two theoretical perspectives used to investigate and understand the relationship between technology and theology will be mentioned, namely the instrumentalist and the cultural approach. The mediatisation theory will be discussed as a theory that fits within the cultural approach to media and religion. Furthermore, the mediatisation theory will serve as a theoretical lens to provide insight into how the changes and shifts discussed are changing religion and religious authority.Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: The article draws on literature from cultural, media and religious studies and intends to stimulate and challenge theological reflection on the theme of mediatisation of religion and the implications for religious authority. Furthermore the article contributes to interdisciplinary research within theology.Keywords: Religion; mediation; religious authority; media},

The results reveal two main content clusters: religious practice involving social/lifestyle issues and political activism around Muslim grievances. Victimization, found in 150 videos, was the most common indicator associated with radicalization and emerged as a source of political activism and subversive discourse. Overall, indicators of radicalism were scarce, suggesting that visible mainstream Islamic creators do not exhibit high levels of radical ideology. However, this also reflects a selection bias in the design of this study, which systematically overlooks fringe actors. In addition, religious advocacy was the most common topic (1144 videos), serving as a source of guidance and motivation, but was occasionally linked to sectarianism and rigid religious interpretations. Male creators posted more religious/theological videos; female creators posted more lifestyle videos. However, gender distinctions are limited due to the low representation of female creators (6). Some topics, such as the hijab, served as an intersection between religious practice and politicized narratives. This study highlights {TikTok}’s role in promoting diverse ideological views and shaping community engagement, knowledge sharing, and political mobilization within Germany’s Muslim digital landscape.},

"This manuscript takes us on a timely and much-needed tour which helps us explore the complexity, dynamism, and nuances of modern Muslim identities, as they are being shaped by, while also shaping, various forms of mediated popular culture, ranging from comic books to fashion magazines and reality {TV} shows, among others. In doing so, it unpacks the complexity of the varied, and oftentimes intersecting and overlapping, roles of Muslims in contemporary societies, as both "producers" and "consumers" of these varied forms of mediated popular culture simultaneously."--Sahar Khamis, coauthor of Islam Dot Com: Contemporary Islamic Discourses in Cyberspace In the West, Islam and Muslim life have been imagined to exist in an antithetical state to popular culture--a frozen faith unable to engage with the dynamic way popular culture shifts over time, its followers reduced to tropes of terrorism and enemies of the state. Pop Islam: Seeing American Muslims in Popular Media traces narratives found in contemporary American comic books, scripted and reality television, fashion magazines, comedy routines, and movies to understand how they reveal nuanced Muslim identities to American audiences, even as their accessibility obscures their diversity. Rosemary Pennington argues that even as American Muslims have become more visible in popular media and created space for themselves in everything from magazines to prime-time television to social media, this move toward "being seen" can reinforce fixed ideas of what it means to be Muslim. To truly understand where American narratives of who Muslims are come from, we must engage with popular media while also considering who is allowed to be seen there-and why"--},

Social media companies often deny this content moderation practice despite user experiences online. In this paper, we use qualitative surveys and interviews to understand how marginalized social media users make sense of shadowbanning, develop folk theories about shadowbanning, and attempt to prove its occurrence. We find that marginalized social media users collaboratively develop and test algorithmic folk theories to make sense of their unclear experiences with shadowbanning. Participants reported direct consequences of shadowbanning, including frustration, decreased engagement, the inability to post specific content, and potential financial implications. They reported holding negative perceptions of platforms where they experienced shadowbanning, sometimes attributing their shadowbans to platforms' deliberate suppression of marginalized users' content. Some marginalized social media users acted on their theories by adapting their social media behavior to avoid potential shadowbans. We contributecollaborative algorithm investigation : a new concept describing social media users' strategies of collaboratively developing and testing algorithmic folk theories. Finally, we present design and policy recommendations for addressing shadowbanning and its potential harms.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 has been considered a new industrial stage in which several emerging technologies are converging to provide digital solutions. However, there is a lack of understanding of how companies implement these technologies. Thus, we aim to understand the adoption patterns of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing firms. We propose a conceptual framework for these technologies, which we divided into front-end and base technologies. Front-end technologies consider four dimensions: Smart Manufacturing, Smart Products, Smart Supply Chain and Smart Working, while base technologies consider four elements: internet of things, cloud services, big data and analytics. We performed a survey in 92 manufacturing companies to study the implementation of these technologies. Our findings show that Industry 4.0 is related to a systemic adoption of the front-end technologies, in which Smart Manufacturing plays a central role. Our results also show that the implementation of the base technologies is challenging companies, since big data and analytics are still low implemented in the sample studied. We propose a structure of Industry 4.0 technology layers and we show levels of adoption of these technologies and their implication for manufacturing companies.},

We identify four major themes in the literature on platform work and the underlying metaphors associated with each. Platforms are seen as entrepreneurial incubators, digital cages, accelerants of precarity, and chameleons adapting to their environments. Each of these devices has limitations, which leads us to introduce an alternative image of platforms: as permissive potentates that externalize responsibility and control over economic transactions while still exercising concentrated power. As a consequence, platforms represent a distinct type of governance mechanism, different from markets, hierarchies, or networks, and therefore pose a unique set of problems for regulators, workers, and their competitors in the conventional economy. Reflecting the instability of the platform structure, struggles over regulatory regimes are dynamic and difficult to predict, but they are sure to gain in prominence as the platform economy grows.},

This article consists of a qualitative textual analysis of a selection of Twitter posts from December 3 to 7, 2014, following the nonindictments of officers in the murders of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The debates on Twitter reveal various strategies that youth of color employed to shape the national discourse about race in the wake of these high-profile tragedies.},

Using a high-volume sample from the microblogging site Twitter, we investigate changes in Occupy participant engagement, interests, and social connectivity over a fifteen month period starting three months prior to the movement's first protest action. The results of this analysis indicate that, on Twitter, the Occupy movement tended to elicit participation from a set of highly interconnected users with pre-existing interests in domestic politics and foreign social movements. These users, while highly vocal in the months immediately following the birth of the movement, appear to have lost interest in Occupy related communication over the remainder of the study period.},

In this context, {TikTok} has emerged as a platform where viral videos are often posted first. In this paper, we study what elements of short videos posted on {TikTok} contribute to their virality. We apply a mixed-method approach to develop a codebook and identify important virality features. We do so vis-à-vis three research hypotheses; namely, that: 1) the video content, 2) {TikTok}’s recommendation algorithm, and 3) the popularity of the video creator contributes to virality. We collect and label a dataset of 400 {TikTok} videos and train classifiers to help us identify the features that influence virality the most. While the number of followers is the most powerful predictor, close-up and medium-shot scales also play an essential role. So does the lifespan of the video, the presence of text, and the point of view. Our research highlights the characteristics that distinguish viral from non-viral {TikTok} videos, laying the groundwork for developing additional approaches to create more engaging online content and proactively identify possibly risky content that is likely to reach a large audience.},

This paper asks what the rationale and effects of disruptive protest are. It argues that disruptive protest carries a prefigurative legitimacy, envisaging a more democratic and just society while aiming for broader appeal and legitimacy rendered by liberal discourses. The paper takes a political theory perspective through both the literature on civil disobedience and the anarchist literature on direct action. It then explores how the key attributes of these literatures render legitimacy to the practices and discourses of two social movements that have made widespread use of disruptive protest in recent years: the Spanish anti-eviction movement Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca ({PAH}) and the mainly British climate change movement Extinction Rebellion ({XR}).},

	abstract = {[Activism is defined in this paper as involving local instigations of new series of elements intersecting the actual, generating new collective enunciations, experimentations and investigations, which erode good and common sense and cause structures to swing away from their sedimented identities. By appealing to Spinozism, the paper describes the microphysics of the activist encounter with stable structures and the ways in which activism imposes new regimes of succession of ideas and affective variations in the power of action. Rather than understanding activism as supporting or leading social struggles, the definition of activism pursued here conceives it as an open-ended process and stresses the role of investigation in relation to practices within the social situations to which activism addresses itself.]},

This article reviews the available information on sexual harassment in cyberspace, equates this phenomenon with what has been learned about sexual harassment offline, points to specific characteristics of online culture and technology that reinforce the behavior, and proposes ways of promoting prevention.},

	abstract = {Cyber violence has emerged as a new source of minority stress over the past decade. Due to the anonymous and unrestrictive nature of the internet, cyber violence is even more blatant and pervasive than in person violence for sexual minority individuals. The present study aimed to examine whether and how online and offline experiences of heterosexism are related to physical and mental health. A total of 941 sexual minority individuals participated in a community-based online survey study. The findings indicated that online heterosexist experiences explained variance in physical and mental health, beyond the contribution of offline heterosexist experiences. Among sexual minority young adults, the effect of online heterosexist experiences on mental health was stronger than that of offline heterosexist experiences, whereas the association between online heterosexist experiences and health problems was not observed in the adult sample. The results of mediation analysis showed that heterosexist experiences were related to heightened expectations of rejection, which, in turn, were related to poor physical and mental health. The association of heterosexist experiences and mental health was also mediated by negative affect. Given the detrimental effect of online heterosexist experiences, effective interventions are needed to combat cyber violence motivated by sexual orientation and enhance the coping and confrontation strategies in response to harmful online content.},
