## Reserach Questions {.smaller}

> There remains a critical research gap regarding the content produced by German Muslims on TikTok and its impact on users. Major questions remain unanswered: **What content do German Muslims produce on TikTok, and how does this content lead to radicalization or not?** Against this backdrop, this dissertation examines the representation of German Muslims on TikTok and the consequences of this representation. The fundamental research questions that guide this study are:

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

<li><strong>RQ1:</strong> What topics and issues do German Muslims address in their TikTok content?</li>

<li><strong>RQ2:</strong> How does this content relate to religion, (anti-Muslim) grievances, and radical ideologies?</li>

<li><strong>RQ3:</strong> How does the consumption of this content affect the values and attitudes of German Muslim TikTok users? Does it promote radicalization and/or act as a preventive force?</li>

## What is Radicalization? {auto-animate="true"}

> The adaptation of attitudes and behaviors that constitute "a significant deviation \[...\] from basic legal and political norms and values within a social system (society or state) that seek their (at least partial) abolition and replacement" [@beelmann_social-developmental_2020, 2]

::: footer
Theory
:::

## What is Radicalization? {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

-   "The concept of radicalization as a source of confusion" [@sedgwick_concept_2010]
-   "\[...\] readiness to engage in illegal and violent political action" [@moskalenko_measuring_2009, 240]
-   "to be a radical is to reject the status quo, but not necessarily in a violent or even problematic manner. Some radicals conduct, support, or encourage terrorism, whilst many others do no such thing, and actively and often effectively agitate against it" [@bartlet_edge_2012, 2]
-   "advocating sweeping political change, based on a conviction that the status quo is unacceptable while at the same time a fundamentally different alternative appears to be available to the radical" [@schmid_radicalisation_2013, 8]

### The common sense

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 6

flowchart LR
    Content --> Radicalization
```

-   Exposure to extremist content potentially leads to radicalization [@hassan_exposure_2018]

-   One mechanism cited is information provision [@molmen_mechanisms_2021]

-   "a grievance, a culprit, and a method" [@kruglanski_psychology_2014, 382]

-   Opposite should be possible in theory as well

    -   Media diets and the "echo chamber" [@dubois_echo_2018]

    -   Diversity of ideas and dogmatism [@hunsberger_religious_1994; @kruglanski_psychology_2004]

    Engagement --> Radicalization
```

-   TikTok is somewhat based on "voluntary" consumption (ForYou-Page)

-   TikTok's logic of content production, consumption, interaction, and visibility [@abbasi_tiktok_2023; @abidin_mapping_2020; @barta_constructing_2021; @bhandari_whys_2022; @schellewald_understanding_2023; @vaterlaus_tiktok_2021]

-   Factors such as relatability, authenticity, humor, controversy, and even video length play a critical role in driving user engagement

-   Sound, music, visual effects, and the overall video production itself has a significant impact on how engaging and watchable a video is [@cheng_like_2023; @ling_slapping_2022; @schellewald_understanding_2023]

-   **Media content must be persuasive to cause attitude change**

-   @slater_television_2006, 238: engrossing narratives or characters, perceived similarities (cognitive), sharing emotions and experiences (affective)

-   @polletta_when_2020, 4: The power of stories to mobilize a recipient "lies in their ability to elicit empathy for the protagonist and, as a result, support for the larger cause" (4) and **victim effect**

-   Demopgrahic, individual, micro-, and macro-environmental factors affect risk towards radicalization [@beelmann_social-developmental_2020; @campelo_who_2018, @emmelkamp_risk_2020]

-   **Victimization and marginalization a central facilitator**

-   Thus, psycho-social contextual factors influence the susceptibility to radicalization, the potential of (victim) narratives to persuade, the willingness to get involved, as well as the content suggested by both personal/shared interests.

Findings
:::

## General Content Characteristics

-   **Wide range of topics:** Personal/social life (family, relationships), beauty, fashion, self-care, food, DIY, lifestyle.
-   **Platform norms:** Content reflects TikTok’s logic—entertainment-driven, focused on engagement, authenticity, relatability, and self-commodification.
-   **Creative strategies:** Use of trends, formats, humour, storytelling, and reciprocity with users

::: footer
Findings
:::

## Religious and Advocacy Content {.smaller}

-   **Religious expression:** Covers theology, hijab, lived religion, moral issues, and guidance on family and gender roles.
-   **Activism and advocacy:** Creators challenge stereotypes and raise awareness about racism, discrimination, and exclusion.
-   **Empowerment:** Content empowers Muslim women and provides visibility, agency, and a third space for self-representation.
-   **Role model function:** Creators act as informal educators, especially where formal religious representation is lacking.
-   **Two strains of Muslim TikTok:** Religious vs Political Advocacy

::: footer
Findings
:::

## Algorithmic Affordances and Challenges {.smaller}

-   **Low-barrier visibility:** TikTok’s algorithm enables even small accounts to gain traction, increasing access for marginalized voices.
-   **Risk of exposure:** Increased visibility also makes creators more vulnerable to hate and algorithmic limitations (entertainment bias, limited reach).
-   **Platform moderation:** Potential extremist content may be removed or obscured through moderation; some content uses coded language ("algospeak") to evade filters.

::: footer
Discussion
:::

## Radical Ideology Dynamics {.smaller}

-   **Grievance-based narratives:** Victimhood (e.g., media bias, Islamophobia, geopolitical injustices) is central to content that may foster radicalisation.
-   **Three-part radicalization**:
    -   Grievance: Structural victimhood of Muslims.
    -   Culprit: Systemic oppression by Western institutions/media.
    -   Method: Need for radical change, sometimes framed as religious duty.
-   **Contrasting outcomes**: While some content promotes justice and pluralism, others undermine socio-political legitimacy (e.g. caliphate advocacy).
-   **Religious vs Political**: Muslim as a Believer vs. Muslim as a Member

::: footer
Discussion
:::

## Dual Role of TikTok Content

-   **Integration and belonging:** Content supports social cohesion by equipping users to navigate diverse societies.
-   **Challenge and critique:** Content also mobilizes against injustice, expressing dissatisfaction and demanding change.
-   **Extremism hijacks these roles**

::: footer
Discussion
:::

## Central Methodological Limitations

-   **Selection bias:** Focus on popular accounts may miss fringe or extremist content or "non-performing" Muslims
-   **Visibility bias:** Popular content may reflect mainstream-compatible themes; less visible radical content may still reach users before moderation.

## Summary

-   **Overall resilience:** Participants’ attitudes remained largely stable over the 14-day period.
-   Slight increase in violent attitudes in the treatment group, but changes were not statistically significant.
-   Democracy support remained high across all groups.
-   Religiosity and older age correlated with lower likelihood of attitude change toward violence.

::: footer
Discussion
:::

## Positive signals: Control Group

-   Despite reporting highest post-intervention levels of perceived discrimination, the control group showed:
    -   Minimal change in political attitudes.
    -   No increase in support for violence—some even showed slight decreases.
    -   Suggests preventive potential of positive TikTok content
    
::: footer
Discussion
:::

## Contextual Insights {.smaller}

-   Swipe culture moderates radicalization risks:
    -   Most participants did not watch full videos.
    -   Few remembered or agreed with radical messages.
    -   Interest and attention span are crucial for engagement and potential influence.
-   **Likes ≠ agreement:** Some used likes to acknowledge grievances, not endorse ideologies.
-   **Engagement data:** Most videos viewed only briefly (5 seconds to \~20 seconds), meaning radical calls-to-action at the end were often missed.

::: footer
Discussion
:::

## Case Insight

-   A participant who liked/saved all radical videos later reported being shocked rather than persuaded and showed less radical views after the study.
-   Some participants consumed up to 465 videos/day.
-   Radical content appears as a minority in a flood of entertainment content, questioning how much exposure is needed for influence to occur.

::: footer
Discussion
:::

## Limitations {#limitations .smaller}

-   **Sample size limited**; a larger N would improve detection of rare radicalization effects.
-   Study duration and number of videos/accounts should be expanded.
-   Unobserved heterogeneity likely influenced outcomes (e.g., trauma, personal grievances, psychological dispositions).
-   Contextual events (e.g., Gaza war) may have affected results independently of the intervention.
-   Social desirability bias affects self-reported data on radical beliefs/actions.

## Outlook {.smaller}

- **Radicalization remains politicised and evolving**, especially through social media. Muslims continue to be disproportionately targeted in security discourses, often framed as sources of risk in connection with migration.

- This dissertation addresses that context, offering a **critical study of Muslim TikTok**, combining qualitative and experimental methods to understand how content relates to grievance, identity, and radicalization.

- Findings suggest **overall resilience** among users, alongside evidence of **context-dependent content engagement**, with sociocultural meaning often misinterpreted (e.g., likes ≠ endorsement).

- **Qualitative research is essential**: it uncovers meaning, intent, and user practices, especially where quantitative models cannot fully explain engagement patterns.

- **Digital phenomena must be studied on their own terms**, using adaptive, platform-sensitive methods that reflect the realities of algorithmic content delivery.

::: footer
Discussion
:::

## Outlook {.smaller}

- **Computational methods** (e.g., LLMs, text analysis, user data donations) are crucial for understanding actual exposure and platform effects, allowing measurement beyond content production.

- Future research must shift toward the **consumer perspective**, tracing how users interact with recommended content, not just what is posted.

- Scholars must **navigate between Big Tech optimism and alarmism**—recognising digital spaces as both empowering and potentially harmful.

- Research must remain **critical, reflexive, and ethically aware**: distinguishing between real threats and racialised narratives, and challenging the **securitisation of Muslims** in both policy and scholarship.

- Ultimately, radicalization research must ask: what do we label as “objectionable,” under what conditions, and with what consequences?
