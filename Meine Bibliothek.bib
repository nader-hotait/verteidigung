In light of this, different policies have been implemented focused on cybersecurity, like the creation of specialized centers like the European Cybercrime Center or the {US} Threat Intelligence Integration Center. This chapter offers some analytics about the use that {ISIS} is giving to cyberspace, from recruitment purposes, to propaganda, financial support or even psycho-war.

Many related social and psychological theories have been put forward, however terrorism literature still lacks empirical research. In particular, little is known about the early processes and pathways to radicalization. Our aim is to investigate original research on pathways and processes associated with radicalization and extremism amongst people of Muslim heritage living in Western societies, that is, the group prioritized by counter-terrorism policy. Studies included in the review were original qualitative or quantitative primary research published in peer-reviewed journals, identified by searching research databases. All disciplines of journals were included. No single cause or pathway was implicated in radicalization and violent extremism. Individuals may demonstrate vulnerabilities that increase exposure to radicalization; however, the only common characteristic determined that terrorists are generally well-integrated, 'normal' individuals. Engagement in such activity is dependent on a wide range of interacting variables influenced by personal, localized and externalized factors. Further research should examine broader determinants of radicalization in susceptible populations. Future policy should follow this public health approach rather than constructing from perpetrators already committed to engaging in terrorism. © 2015 Institute of Psychiatry.},

Of the 5,182 studies generated from the searches, 11 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. We considered empirical studies with qualitative, quantitative, and mixed designs, but did not conduct meta-analysis due to the heterogeneous and at times incomparable nature of the data. The reviewed studies provide tentative evidence that exposure to radical violent online material is associated with extremist online and offline attitudes, as well as the risk of committing political violence among white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and radical Islamist groups. Active seekers of violent radical material also seem to be at higher risk of engaging in political violence as compared to passive seekers. The Internet's role thus seems to be one of decision-shaping, which, in association with offline factors, can be associated to decision-making. The methodological limitations of the reviewed studies are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research.},

	abstract = {Since Simmel's seminal essay on secret societies, little systematic work on the topic has been attempted even though the empirical basis for such work has greatly improved. The present paper uses six case studies with unusually good structural detail in analyzing one aspect of secret societies: Their organizational structure. In contrast with Simmel, I argue that secret societies under risk must be differentiated from others; that societies under risk have a wide range of structural forms; and that the major sources of structure are found in preexisting social structures rather than in psychological factors. Risk enforces recruitment along lines of trust, thus through preexisting networks of relationships, which set the limits of the secret society's structure. Structure can still vary considerably, depending primarily on the centralization of control of recruitment, in turn dependent on the control of key resources.

Nearly all text-based causal inferences depend on a latent representation of the text, but we show that estimating this latent representation from the data creates underacknowledged risks: we may introduce an identification problem or overfit. To address these risks, we introduce a split-sample workflow for making rigorous causal inferences with discovered measures as treatments or outcomes. We then apply it to estimate causal effects from an experiment on immigration attitudes and a study on bureaucratic responsiveness. Identification challenges in causal inference with documents can be addressed with sample splitting.},

	abstract = {A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining which topics that document addresses. We describe a generative model for documents, introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. \&amp; Jordan, M. I. (2003) J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from {PNAS} by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying “hot topics” by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.},

These models can capture word correlations in a collection of textual documents with a low-dimensional set of multinomial distribution, called “topics”. However, it is important but difficult to select the appropriate number of topics for a specific dataset. In this paper, we study the inherent connection between the best topic structure and the distances among topics in Latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA}), and propose a method of adaptively selecting the best {LDA} model based on density. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve performance matching the best of {LDA} without manually tuning the number of topics.},

To solve this problem, we created a set of techniques that utilize a semisupervised model that allows researchers to classify documents into predefined categories efficiently. We propose a dictionary making procedure to avoid inclusion of words that are likely to confuse the model and deteriorate the its classification performance classification accuracy using a new entropy-based diagnostic tool. In our experiments, we classify sentences of the United Nations General Assembly speeches into six predefined categories using the seeded Latent Dirichlet allocation and Newsmap, which were trained with a small “seed word dictionary” that we created following the procedure. The result shows that, while keyword dictionary can only classify 25\% of sentences, Newsmap can classify over 60\% of them accurately correctly and; its accuracy exceeds 70\% when contextual information is taken into consideration by kernel smoothing of topic likelihoods. We argue that once seed word dictionaries are created by the international relations community, semisupervised models would become more useful than unsupervised models for theory-driven text analysis.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.

We argue that the contemporary use of the term “extreme” fails to capture the different interpretations, beliefs, and attitudes defining extreme religious identity. To address this issue, we unpack the meaning of the term “extreme” in religious contexts and answer the call by scholars to provide a more comprehensive framework that incorporates the many different dimensions that constitute religion. We develop a model of religious extremism in theological, ritual, social, and political dimensions of religion based on the variety of Islamic groups in Indonesia. Going beyond an analysis that equates Muslim extremism with violence, we argue that Muslims (or indeed any religious group) may be extreme in some dimensions but moderate in others, e.g., extreme in ritual and moderate in political. Interpreting extremism relative to these four dimensions provides new insights when examining the global issue of religious extremism and helps to better predict how religious extremism is expressed. More generally, our framework helps to develop an understanding of radicalism that goes beyond a focus on violence.},

	abstract = {It is a strategic decision how people find their place in digital media platforms. Such decisions are navigated by structures of power and social constructions like culture, class, gender, media, technology, and individual maneuvers. {TikTok} has been a haven for everyday people in Turkey. This study analyzed how and why that is the case. Looking at the content on {TikTok} and critically engaging with discursive practices around {TikTok} and {TikTokers}, this chapter argues that “cringe” people, who do not share a specific taste and cultural capital, show their presence in {TikTok} due to technological affordances {TikTok} offers, the cultural climate in other platforms, and the carnivalesque which they experience on {TikTok}. It might look like they are only producing dance or dubbing videos, but they claim a cultural sphere. The mediation of this culture, however, is sometimes encouraging and empowering, and sometimes is toxic. © Peter Lang {GmbH} Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2021.},

	abstract = {Social media platforms such as {YouTube}, Facebook, Telegram, and so on have influenced pedagogical practices in improving student learning. However, there is limited literature on the use of the {TikTok} application in teaching and learning and whether this platform helps students or is only for entertainment. The {TikTok} application is one of the social media platforms for sharing short videos that are rapidly increasing in popularity. Therefore, this study reviewed recent literature on the effectiveness of using {TikTok} in teaching and learning from primary to higher education learning. Seven research articles were identified as relevant to this review through the predetermined criteria. The purpose, method, subjects and outcome of the studies were reviewed. It indicated that a complex subject like chemistry could attract the public to enjoy learning chemistry at home and improve undergraduate students learning. Other than that, learning skills like dance and sports through {TikTok} also positively impacts students. Language subjects like English as a Second Language utilise {TikTok} to enhance students' listening, writing and comprehension skills. Future educators in primary, secondary, and higher education may think about integrating {TikTok} into their teaching and learning strategies to stimulate the creation of original videos that adhere to instructional design principles. © {ICCE} 2022.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {{TikTok} has ousted Google as the world’s favorite online destination in 2021. As China’s first emergent social media app making its mark across the Global North and South, it has prompted a shift in our global mediascape. Following in the footsteps of {YouTube} and Instagram after it, {TikTok} is facilitating new identities through User-Generated Content ({UGC}) while challenging the hegemony of American-led platform culture. {UGC} analyzed in this article views it unabashedly as a youthful narcissism through which a form of self-reinvention online is created. This is culturally surmised as an intriguing new form of global creativity that I label ecumenical {UGC}. Yet, scholarship has largely examined {TikTok} through empirical and content analysis frameworks only, negating the compelling cultural studies issues evinced in this trendy media. In conjunction with discussions of {TikTok}’s meteoric rise, this article also probes how the Chinese company that owns this app bends several {UNESCO} media principles, creating its mediatic split with its twin, Douyin operating only in the {PRC}. By laying out this other path, one detects a shrinkage of cultural globalization in the pandemic era as {TikTok} becomes a carrier of ‘underglobalization’ flows, a disrupter and provider of algorithmic content, all going under not against older notions of global culture. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Social media users have long been aware of opaque content moderation systems and how they shape platform environments. On {TikTok}, creators increasingly utilize algospeak to circumvent unjust content restriction, meaning, they change or invent words to prevent {TikTok}’s content moderation algorithm from banning their video (e.g., “le\$bean” for “lesbian”). We interviewed 19 {TikTok} creators about their motivations and practices of using algospeak in relation to their experience with {TikTok}’s content moderation. Participants largely anticipated how {TikTok}’s algorithm would read their videos, and used algospeak to evade unjustified content moderation while simultaneously ensuring target audiences can still find their videos. We identify non-contextuality, randomness, inaccuracy, and bias against marginalized communities as major issues regarding freedom of expression, equality of subjects, and support for communities of interest. Using algospeak, we argue for a need to improve contextually informed content moderation to valorize marginalized and tabooed audiovisual content on social media. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Regarding news about jihadism, many researchers have observed that those who practice Islam are classified as a monolithic entity, and this entire religious group is generalized as a threat to modern societies. The main objective of our research is thus to know the discourses used on {TikTok} to respond to the binomial Islam = terrorism spread by mainstream media and the affordances of this platform used to challenge this miscon-ception. Using the snowball method, a multimodal analysis was conducted by identifying {TikTok} videos with the hashtags \#yihadista, \#yihad, and \#islamterrorismo (in its English and Spanish versions) to explore the uses of the {TikTok} platform. The resulting selection criteria included: (a) content related to mainstream media discourses on jihadism, (b) discussion of a topic related to Islam and terrorism, and (c) where the content creator declares him/herself to be a Muslim. In addi-tion, in‐depth interviews were conducted to provide an enhanced understanding of how the media promote the need to generate a counter‐narrative on {TikTok}. The results reveal that discourses from Muslims that combat Islam = terrorism discourses are constructed within the spiral of the dominant narrative, thus visualizing the negative discourses about Islam. © 2023 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: {TikTok} social media app has become one of the most popular forms of leisure and entertainment activities, but how hedonic consumption experiences (comprising fantasy, escapism, enjoyment, role projection, sensory, arousal and emotional involvement) of the {TikTok} app determine users' intention to use the app and its resulting impact on the actual usage behavior remains limited in the information systems literature, especially featuring the hedonic consumption perspective in entertainment industry. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs uses \& gratification theory to answer the “why” via predicting the role of hedonic consumption experiences that serve as gratifications to trigger technology acceptance behavior (especially, in form of users' behavioral intention to use the {TikTok} app and its further impact on usage behavior). This study utilizes the partial least squares-structural equation modeling approach to perform data analyses on 258 {TikTok} app users. Findings: Our results provide a strong support such that users' playful consumption experiences (i.e. escapism, role projection, arousal, sensory experience and enjoyment) positively influence their intention to use the {TikTok} app and its resultant effect on users' actual usage of the app. In contrast, fantasy and emotional involvement fail to influence users' intention to use the {TikTok} app. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, our investigation is one of the first studies to apply the hedonic consumption experiences as potential gratifications that derive users' intention and its subsequent influence on the actual usage of the {TikTok} app. Our study results would assist marketing and brand managers to redefine approaches and tactics to create effective strategies that implement essential determinants to increase behavioral intention among entertainment service providers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this study, we examine how Asian/American women creatively occupy the \#{StopAsianHate} hashtag on {TikTok} to counter anti-Asian racism and form pan-Asian solidarity. We analyze their participation in the \#{StopAsianHate} hashtag as anti-racist space-making practices, which we define as the act of carving out discursive spaces to spread counter-narratives to anti-Asian racism and claiming space through their agentive, visual presence. Drawing upon Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis ({CTDA}) as our method, we analyze 130 \#{StopAsianHate} {TikTok} videos by Asian/American women and examine how their anti-racist space-making practices draw upon the features and cultures of {TikTok}. We illustrate how Asian/American women extend the discussion on anti-Asian racism to include their gendered and raced experiences, and challenge racism in affective and evocative ways. We conclude by discussing how their space-making practices foster an ad hoc community for Asian/Americans across differences amid rising anti-Asian hate crimes. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Meanwhile, news publishers are embracing {TikTok} to reach a younger audience. We aim to examine the content strategy adopted by the most-followed news publishers on {TikTok} and how effective their {TikTok} strategy is in spurring audience engagement in terms of liking, commenting, and sharing. This study retrieved 101,292 {TikTok} news videos as of November 22, 2022. With the help of computer vision, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis, we found that {TikTok} news videos containing negative sentiment and more second-person view shots are associated with significantly higher audience engagement. In addition, this study demonstrated that the {TikTok} video features and engagement levels differ between the news publishers and other {TikTok} creators. Moderator analysis shows that both the effect of negative sentiment on engagement and the effect of the second-person view on engagement are moderated by the {TikTok} account type. The impact of negative sentiment and second-person view on engagement behaviors becomes smaller or even insignificant for news publisher {TikTok} videos.

Results are discussed in relation to Uses and Gratifications theory and {TikTok} was found to meet realism, coolness, agency-enhancement, community building, bandwagon, interactivity, browsing/variety seeking, and play/fun gratifications. In terms of failed gratifications for past-users and non-users, {TikTok} was perceived to be too juvenile/cringey and providing too much (cyberbullying) or not enough agency (privacy and censorship). © 2021 Western Social Science Association.},

To do so, a study was carried out on the content of publications on {TikTok} in four countries with different idiosyncrasies and national realities: Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and the United States. Interviews were also conducted with fact-checking agencies on the potential for misinformation and fact-checking potential on this social network. The results suggest that due to its characteristics as a fresh, visual network with easily shareable and viral content, {TikTok} is a network that facilitates the spread of disinformation, but which in turn is a tool for debunking hoaxes beyond the range of action of conventional media. © 2021.

	abstract = {Purpose: Although the short-video-based application {TikTok} and its {AI}-enhanced technology have achieved enormous success and reshaped the user experience, few studies have focused on the user experience in the {TikTok} context. This study adopts a technology affordance theory lens to identify the main mechanisms contributing to the user experience in the short-video platform context while including user experience level and video length as moderating effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 401 valid questionnaires from {TikTok} users and used the structural equation modeling approach to examine the proposed research model. Findings: Three technology affordances (perceived effortlessness, perceived recommendation accuracy, and perceived recommendation serendipity) contribute to {TikTok} users' optimal flow experience. Multi-group analysis results further indicate that individuals react differently to the same stimuli as their experience level increases. Finally, video length critically influences the impact of technology affordances on users' cognitive responses. Originality/value: As a burgeoning industry, the mechanisms enabling short-video platforms to engage users remain unclear to practitioners and researchers. Thus, this study's technology affordance lens provides necessary insights into how {TikTok}'s innovative and advanced technologies contribute to user flow experience from a context-dependent perspective. Furthermore, given that most existing studies have neglected possible variations in user preferences when investigating the effects of technology, this study enriches the existing literature by employing user experience level and video length as moderators. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Spanish-Moroccan mixed couples exemplify a case of cultural hybridization that reflects the colonial past between these two countries. In this context, social media is a space of opportunity and risk to face discrimination and othering. In this article, we draw upon postcolonial theory and Internet studies to consider {TikTok} affordances as tools that are relevant to understand how cultural, national, and religious identities are shaped and presented in digital spaces. In this sense, this study constitutes the first exploratory analysis of Moroccan-Spanish mixed couples’ (self)representations and identity construction as reflected by their {TikTok} content. The memetic and intersectional aspects of the mixed-couple identity emerge as central in the convergent nature of the platform and their lived experiences. Through an initial analysis of 8,653 {TikTok} videos, we identified 6 creator accounts with more than 10K followers to conduct a deeper multimodal content and discourse analysis of 146 videos. This enabled us to explore how these creators portray their hybrid identity through short, vertical videos harnessing {TikTok}’s vernaculars and affordances. The results enable us to propose the concept of performative hybridization, which involves discursive markers within these couples’ {TikTok} content that reflect a fluid integration of two cultures, while the pervading visual and narrative components reflect the dominance of one set of identity traits over the other. In this case, Moroccan culture is more prevalent. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Yet, while most of the scholarly attention has been focused on leading platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, the extremist immigration to other platforms like {TikTok} went unnoticed. {TikTok} is the fastest-growing application today, attracting a huge audience of 1.2 billion active users, mostly children and teenagers. This report is based on two studies, conducted in 2020 and 2021, applying a systematic content analysis of {TikTok} videos, comments, and even usernames. Data were collected twice, in two four-month periods, February–May 2020 and February–May 2021, to allow for comparisons of changes and trends over time. Our findings highlighted the alarming presence of extreme antisemitic messages in video clips, songs, comments, texts, pictures, and symbols presented in {TikTok}’s content. {TikTok}’s algorithm is even more disconcerting since it leads to a spiral of hate: it pushes users who unintentionally view disturbing content to view more. Considering {TikTok}’s young demographic, these findings are more than alarming; {TikTok} even fails to apply its own Terms of Service, which do not allow content “deliberately designed to provoke or antagonize people, or are intended to harass, harm, hurt, scare, distress, embarrass or upset people or include threats of physical violence”. © 2021 by the authors.},

However, what is meant by the ‘subject’ is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers’ subjectification on {TikTok} as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers’ short-form {TikTok} videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on {TikTok} as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of {TikTok} for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies. At the same time, it suggests that platforms’ transnational affordances in Global South contexts occur independently to Northcentric frameworks and interpretations. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {{TikTok}, a short-video app featuring video content typically between 15 and 60 s long, has become immensely popular around the world in the last few years. However, the worldwide popularity of {TikTok} requires the platform to constantly negotiate with the rules, norms and regulatory frameworks of the regions where it operates. Failure to do so has had significant consequences. For example, for content-related reasons, the platform has been (temporarily and permanently) banned in several countries, including India, Indonesia and Pakistan. Moreover, its Chinese ownership and popularity among underage users have made the platform subject to heightened scrutiny and criticism. In this paper, we introduce the notion of visibility moderation, defined as the process through which digital platforms manipulate the reach of user-generated content through algorithmic or regulatory means. We discuss particular measures {TikTok} implements to shape visibility and issues arising from it. This paper presents findings from interviews with content creators, which takes a user-centric approach to understand their sense-making of and negotiation with {TikTok}'s visibility moderation. Findings from this study also highlight concerns that leave these stakeholders feeling confused, frustrated or powerless, which offer important directions for further research. © 2022 The Authors.

Informed by Uses and Gratifications Theory, the present study investigates the flow states experienced when using each social media platform and whether these flow states differentially impact user well-being. A flow state is achieved when people are so engrossed in an activity that little else seems to matter to them and they will often continue the activity despite its negative consequences. Based upon a survey of adult Instagram (n = 195, Mage = 38) and {TikTok} users (n = 225, Mage = 37), the present study identified four unique clusters of users for both platforms based upon the levels of five flow dimensions: focused attention, curiosity, enjoyment, telepresence, and time distortion. Results found that {TikTok} users reported higher levels of overall flow than Instagram users. {TikTok} users also reported higher levels of the flow dimensions "enjoyment"and "time distortion."The flow dimension of "telepresence"(immersion in a world created by the social media application) for both {TikTok} and Instagram users was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. These social media may provide an escape from everyday worries for users, although a suboptimal coping strategy. Whether Instagram and {TikTok} use are but "improved means to an unimproved end"is an important question that requires additional research.  © 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

This study focused on the personality traits and narcissistic behavior of university students about whether they use {TikTok} or make a short-form video for getting attention to have self-esteem, need to belong, or need for admiration and how much time they spent on these social sites. The study focused to examine {TikTok} addiction by surveying 350 university students through a purposive sampling technique. The study found that a positive correlation exists between independent, dependent, and mediating variables. In addition to this, the results showed that only grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism have a direct effect on the {TikTok} addiction. On the other hand, the need for admiration has also a direct effect on {TikTok} addiction. For the specific indirect effect, neuroticism, which is a personality trait, has no indirect effect on the addition of {TikTok} through the mediators like need to belong, need for admiration, and self-esteem. This study highlights the contribution towards the media-related research that can be identified by the general public. Hence policymakers can make strategies for social media users to overcome addictive tendencies. Copyright © 2022 by Cherkas Global University.},

Within this context, this introduction to the Special Issue titled “{TikTok} and Social Movements” begins by thinking about how social media pop cultures have served as a vehicle for mobilizing and engaging in social movements for social (in)justice and politics in the era of social media. By situating {TikTok}, a nascent platform and culture of short video, within the ongoing discussion of digitally mobilized movements and social justice, this introduction addresses several crucial points to consider when discussing {TikTok} cultures and social movements that are happening or interrupted on the platform. These points are interrogated with more details and cultural contexts in the five case studies and three expert commentaries in this Special Issue. Specifically, the collection of papers interrogate how {TikTok}’s interactive and creative affordances have augmented and altered our cultures, practices, politics, and power dynamics of engaging with publics for various beliefs and social agendas. © The Author(s) 2023.},

While its popularity is undeniable, at the first glance, it seems to offer features already available on previously existing and well-established platforms such as Instagram, {YouTube}, and Facebook. To understand processes of self-making on {TikTok}, we undertake two methods of data collection: a walkthrough of the app and its surrounding environment, and 14 semistructured participant interviews. A qualitative analysis of this data finds three distinct themes emerge: (1) awareness of the algorithm, (2) content without context, and (3) self-creation across platforms. These results show that {TikTok} departs from existing platforms in the model of self-making it engenders, which we term “the algorithmized self”—a complication of the pre-existing “networked self” framework. © The Author(s) 2022.},

This chapter offers an analysis of how the World Wide Web and digital technologies influence gender identity politics in contemporary Russian society. We look at the ways Russians construct gender online, how their practices become means of resistance and activism, and how they adapt and shape digital technologies to perform their gender identities and communicate with the State in the situation of increasing surveillance and control of material and cyberspaces.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, marked by the supposedly universal access to different types of social media, we have seen the emergence of forms of popular feminism embedded in complex dynamics. Often cohabiting in these dynamics are ambivalent ideas and imaginaries that both reject and express feminist issues. Particularly during the {COVID}-19 pandemic, the use of digital technologies increased exponentially to overcome mobility constraints, popularizing connective action around feminism and, at the same time, reinforcing normative views of society. This article explores these ambivalences by focusing on {TikTok} discourses, whose popularity grew intensely during the pandemic. Departing from a feminist constructionist perspective and using content analysis, we examine the 100 most prominent videos on the Portuguese hashtags \#feminismo (\#feminism) and \#antifeminismo (\#antifeminism) in the period corresponding to general containment measures in the second phase of the public health crisis. The results are less than encouraging. Over half of the analysed videos contain discursive dynamics conforming to social hierarchization (53\%), often reaffirming gender stereotypes. By allowing forms of popular feminism and antifeminism to permeate the shared discourses, the results suggest that the platform gives rise to ideas and discourses that reify unbalanced power relations.},

However, despite its ability to share brands’ viral content, scant research has examined {TikTok} as an advertising vehicle and its implications for viral advertising campaigns. Drawing on the Elaboration Likelihood Model and the concept of self-relevance, the present study explores the impact of perceived personalization of {TikTok} content on perceived creativity, authenticity, and viral behavioral intentions. The relationships between perceived creativity and authenticity and between viral behavioral intentions and purchase intentions are also examined. The results show that the personalization of {TikTok} content is positively related to perceived creativity and authenticity, which consequently lead to viral behavior intention on {TikTok}. In addition, perceived creativity of {TikTok} content is positively related to authenticity. The findings also suggest that need for uniqueness moderates the relationship between personalization and viral behavioral intentions. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into the roles of perceived creativity, authenticity, and need for uniqueness in the impact of {TikTok}’s personalized content on viral behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications for advertisers are discussed.},

In total, N = 762 posts were manually analyzed. The study shows that female politicians receive more likes when they are visible in a picture compared to male politicians. It also reveals that male and female politicians both refer more to feminine issues than to masculine issues, although the use of feminine issues resulted in less likes. We find that some issues lead to more discussion amongst Instagram users, and that this differs between male and female politicians.

In recent years, however, these debates have gained renewed momentum. Rapid technological change and increased use of digital media have raised questions about how digital technologies change, influence, and shape feminist politics. This book interrogates the digital interface of transnational protest movements and local activism in feminist politics. Examining how global feminist politics is articulated at the nexus of the transnational/national, we take contemporary German protest culture as a case study for the manner in which transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work. The book explores how movements and actions from outside Germany's borders circulate digitally and resonate differently in new local contexts, and further, how these border-crossings transform grass-roots activism as it goes digital. This book was originally published as a special issue of Feminist Media Studies.},

As China’s first emergent social media app making its mark across the Global North and South, it has prompted a shift in our global mediascape. Following in the footsteps of {YouTube} and Instagram after it, {TikTok} is facilitating new identities through User-Generated Content ({UGC}) while challenging the hegemony of American-led platform culture. {UGC} analyzed in this article views it unabashedly as a youthful narcissism through which a form of self-reinvention online is created. This is culturally surmised as an intriguing new form of global creativity that I label ecumenical {UGC}. Yet, scholarship has largely examined {TikTok} through empirical and content analysis frameworks only, negating the compelling cultural studies issues evinced in this trendy media. In conjunction with discussions of {TikTok}’s meteoric rise, this article also probes how the Chinese company that owns this app bends several {UNESCO} media principles, creating its mediatic split with its twin, Douyin operating only in the {PRC}. By laying out this other path, one detects a shrinkage of cultural globalization in the pandemic era as {TikTok} becomes a carrier of ‘underglobalization’ flows, a disrupter and provider of algorithmic content, all going under not against older notions of global culture. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Purpose: {TikTok}, a social media application (app), was originally positioned as a short music video community suitable for young users, and the app is user-generated content ({UGC}) short video of vertical music. Users can make their own creative videos. Following the rhythm of the music, users can shoot various video content, personal talents, life records, performances, dances, plot interpretations, etc. However, what are the profiles and preferences of {TikTok} users, whereby the social media app is mainly developed by {UGC}? What is the impact of {TikTok} on the development of social media? In addition, what is {UGC}'s social media model for user interactions in social networks? The purpose of this paper is to address and study these proposed issues. Design/methodology/approach: All questionnaire items are designed as nominal and ordinal scales (not Likert scale). The obtained data from questionnaires are put into the relational database (N = 2,011). This empirical study takes Taiwan {TikTok} users as the research object, implements data mining analytics to generate user profiles through clustering analysis and further uses association rules’ analysis to analyze social media apps in social network interaction and social apps’ development by proposing two patterns and several meaningful rules. Findings: This study finds that social media apps is a valuable practical research topic on online social media development. In addition, besides the {TikTok}, the authors eagerly await subsequent research to provide more valuable findings of social media apps in both theory and practice. Originality/value: This study presents the research evidences that social media apps such as {TikTok} will be able to transcend the current development pattern of social media and make good use of the media and technology innovation of apps in social development and social informatics. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Instead of focusing on app features and uses within the platform proper, we situate and critically analyse {TikTok} as a platform business in a global media policy and governance context. We first unpack {TikTok}’s platformization process, tracing how {TikTok} gradually diversifies its business models and platform affordances to serve multisided markets. To understand {TikTok}’s platform governance, we systematically analyse and compare its data and content policies for different regions. Crucial to its global expansion, we then look at {TikTok}’s lobbying efforts to maintain government relations and corporate responses after facing multiple regulatory probing by various national governments. {TikTok}’s case epitomizes problems and challenges faced by a slew of globalizing Chinese digital platforms in increasingly contested geopolitics that cut across the chasms and fault lines between the rise of China and India as emergent powers in the {US}-dominated global platform ecosystem. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

	abstract = {Subjectification has been defined as the formation of the subject via discourses while social media bundles audio-visual discourses that afford subjectification. However, what is meant by the ‘subject’ is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers’ subjectification on {TikTok} as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers’ short-form {TikTok} videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on {TikTok} as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of {TikTok} for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies. At the same time, it suggests that platforms’ transnational affordances in Global South contexts occur independently to Northcentric frameworks and interpretations. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Despite their growing popularity, little research has focused on the association between Instagram and {TikTok} use and psychological well-being. Informed by Uses and Gratifications Theory, the present study investigates the flow states experienced when using each social media platform and whether these flow states differentially impact user well-being. A flow state is achieved when people are so engrossed in an activity that little else seems to matter to them and they will often continue the activity despite its negative consequences. Based upon a survey of adult Instagram (n = 195, Mage = 38) and {TikTok} users (n = 225, Mage = 37), the present study identified four unique clusters of users for both platforms based upon the levels of five flow dimensions: focused attention, curiosity, enjoyment, telepresence, and time distortion. Results found that {TikTok} users reported higher levels of overall flow than Instagram users. {TikTok} users also reported higher levels of the flow dimensions "enjoyment"and "time distortion."The flow dimension of "telepresence"(immersion in a world created by the social media application) for both {TikTok} and Instagram users was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. These social media may provide an escape from everyday worries for users, although a suboptimal coping strategy. Whether Instagram and {TikTok} use are but "improved means to an unimproved end"is an important question that requires additional research.  © 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

This study focused on the personality traits and narcissistic behavior of university students about whether they use {TikTok} or make a short-form video for getting attention to have self-esteem, need to belong, or need for admiration and how much time they spent on these social sites. The study focused to examine {TikTok} addiction by surveying 350 university students through a purposive sampling technique. The study found that a positive correlation exists between independent, dependent, and mediating variables. In addition to this, the results showed that only grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism have a direct effect on the {TikTok} addiction. On the other hand, the need for admiration has also a direct effect on {TikTok} addiction. For the specific indirect effect, neuroticism, which is a personality trait, has no indirect effect on the addition of {TikTok} through the mediators like need to belong, need for admiration, and self-esteem. This study highlights the contribution towards the media-related research that can be identified by the general public. Hence policymakers can make strategies for social media users to overcome addictive tendencies. Copyright © 2022 by Cherkas Global University.},

Second, we urge researchers to move away from simplistic measures of social media and to utilize mixed-methods approaches. Third, we advocate for the development of new theories that can be tested longitudinally and that capture the unique influences of social media, rather than relying solely on existing models that were developed for traditional media. Fourth, we provide recommendations regarding practical strategies, such as the inclusion of media literacy campaigns, increased research on the role of reality check disclaimers, and further examination regarding the role of body positivity in prevention and intervention efforts. Finally, we end with recommendations regarding advocacy, such as using social media to harness positive efforts and partnering with social media companies regarding their use of algorithms.},

	abstract = {During the {COVID}-19 pandemic, health-related misinformation and harmful content shared online had a significant adverse effect on society.In an attempt to mitigate this adverse effect, mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and {TikTok} employed soft moderation interventions (i.e., warning labels) on potentially harmful posts.Such interventions aim to inform users about the post's content without removing it, hence easing the public's concerns about censorship and freedom of speech.Despite the recent popularity of these moderation interventions, as a research community, we lack empirical analyses aiming to uncover how these warning labels are used in the wild, particularly during challenging times like the {COVID}-19 pandemic.In this work, we analyze the use of warning labels on {TikTok}, focusing on {COVID}-19 videos.First, we construct a set of 26 {COVID}-19 related hashtags, and then we collect 41K videos that include those hashtags in their description.Second, we perform a quantitative analysis on the entire dataset to understand the use of warning labels on {TikTok}.Then, we perform an in-depth qualitative study, using thematic analysis, on 222 {COVID}-19 related videos to assess the content and the connection between the content and the warning labels.Our analysis shows that {TikTok} broadly applies warning labels on {TikTok} videos, likely based on hashtags included in the description (e.g., 99\% of the videos that contain \#coronavirus have warning labels).More worrying is the addition of {COVID}-19 warning labels on videos where their actual content is not related to {COVID}-19 (23\% of the cases in a sample of 143 English videos that are not related to {COVID}-19).Finally, our qualitative analysis on a sample of 222 videos shows that 7.7\% of the videos share misinformation/harmful content and do not include warning labels, 37.3\% share benign information and include warning labels, and that 35\% of the videos that share misinformation/harmful content (and need a warning label) are made for fun. Our study demonstrates the need to develop more accurate and precise soft moderation systems, especially on a platform like {TikTok} that is extremely popular among people of younger age.},

To describe the availability and content of sexual education on {TikTok}, we conducted a content analysis of themes for 100 sex education?focused videos. We found that female anatomy was the most frequently addressed topic. Sexual pleasure was the second most common theme, within which discussions of the female orgasm and arousal constituted the most common subtheme. Other common themes include contraception and sexual health. These sought-after topics may be incongruent with those presented in standard school- or home-based sex education or interactions with health care providers, and this disconnect suggests opportunities for health care providers and educators to initiate conversations or offer resources on these themes as part of routine interaction. We conclude with recommendations for future research to consider the factual accuracy of sex education on {TikTok} and determine how exposure to this content affects adolescents? understanding of the risks and benefits of intercourse, sexual practices, age- and gender-based sexual norms, and other health behaviors.},

The gender-biased religious lectures delivered in social media by some famous figures perpetuate the discrimination against women in Indonesia. This research answers how and why the religious lectures with gender-biased theme appear massively on social media. By using a qualitative method and feminist approach, the study focuses on the religious preachers on the new social media. This study shows that the large amounts of lectures with the gender-biased theme in social media are inseparable from the role of the promotional accounts. It shares videos of gender-themed propaganda massively and attractively to attract many visitors and followers of these accounts. This study reveals that the massive religious lectures with gender bias on social media are not only dealing with the textual understanding of religious texts but also a matter of the religious commodification. The actors of business could determine the massively particular religious discourse on social media. © 2020 {STAIN} Kudus. All rights reserved.},

The present study explores cultural identity patterns and the sociodemographic and family contexts of 150 Arab Muslim American young adults ages 18-25 who completed an Internet study. The participants fell into three cultural identity groups: High Bicultural, Moderate Bicultural, and High Arab Cultural. Although all three groups demonstrated positive general family functioning, the Moderate Bicultural group was distinct in that they were less likely to be engaged or married, and they experienced less family support and more family acculturative stressors. The results highlight the importance of the family context in contributing to a stronger sense of cultural identity for young adults who fall at the intersection of Arab and American culture and Muslim faith.},

First, it analyses how various genres of European and American video games have constructed the Arab or Muslim Other. Within these games, it demonstrates how the diverse ethnic and religious identities of the Islamic world have been flattened out and reconstructed into a series of social typologies operating within a broader framework of terrorism and hostility. It then contrasts these broader trends in western digital representation with selected video games produced in the Arab world, whose authors have knowingly subverted and refashioned these stereotypes in two unique and quite different fashions. In conclusion, it considers the significance of western attempts to transcend simplified patterns of representation that have dominated the video game industry by offering what are known as 'serious' games.

We analyzed more than 10,000 social media posts on Weibo relating to Muslims and Islam and conducted in-depth interviews with 34 Chinese Muslims who were active users of social media. Our findings reveal an anti-Muslim online frame, and we detail the ways in which Chinese Muslims have sought to influence public policy in order to protect their rights. The participants in this study responded to hateful posts and worked to increase the understanding of their religion and culture by providing glimpses of their daily lives and by discussing Islam.

The themes that emerged were: (1) Islam as a liberal religion; (2) Islam as a religion of extremism and terrorism; (3) Islam as religion of gender discrimination; (4) Islam as a religion of collective identity; and (5) Islam as a humane religion.

	abstract = {Using expert interviews and focus groups, this book investigates the theoretical and practical intersection of misinformation and social media hate in contemporary societies. Social Media and Hate argues that these phenomena, and the extreme violence and discrimination they initiate against targeted groups, are connected to the socio-political contexts, values and behaviours of users of social media platforms such as Facebook, {TikTok}, {ShareChat}, Instagram and {WhatsApp}. The argument moves from a theoretical discussion of the practices and consequences of sectarian hatred, through a methodological evaluation of quantitative and qualitative studies on this topic, to four qualitative case studies of social media hate, and its effects on groups, individuals and wider politics in India, Brazil, Myanmar and the {UK}. The technical, ideological and networked similarities and connections between social media hate against people of African and Asian descent, indigenous communities, Muslims, Dalits, dissenters, feminists, {LGBTQIA} communities, Rohingya and immigrants across the four contexts is highlighted, stressing the need for an equally systematic political response.

The primary attention in this stimulation investigation drives the impulsive buying between the Generation Z of Muslim women customers in Indonesia. This study provides valuable concept to help a company or cosmetic brand grow the marketing strategy for stimulating impulsive behaviour of Generation Z customers on {TikTok} Shop. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey of 256 Muslim women consumers of the Generation Z was used to collect the data. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied to assess the five hypotheses. Findings: The results of this study indicate that micro-celebrities post authenticity has a positive and significant relationship with utilitarian browsing. However, micro-celebrities post authenticity did not have a positive and significant relationship with hedonic browsing. This study also concludes that utilitarian browsing was found to have a positive and significant relationship with hedonic browsing. Finally, hedonic browsing was found to have a positive and significant effect on reminiscence impulse purchase intention and designed impulse purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The primary limitation is the research sample that only consists of Indonesian {TikTok} Shop customers. Next, the researchers could examine the research model in several countries to expand its generalisation. The second one, this research does not consider the origin country of a cosmetic product. The future study must investigate the local and foreign cosmetics to see the preference and the differences in the impulsive purchase, especially for Z women generation customer. Third, this study quantifies the intention to buy impulsively so that the following research must investigate the ownership of the cosmetics product that has been bought before. Finally, the research only involves a quantitative research method. The future study must investigate with another approach, such as a qualitative method or mixed-method, in the impulsive purchase intention context. Practical implications: A cosmetic company or marketer could maximise the authenticity, relevancy and attractive information that is posted by micro media social celebrities or media social influencers. Cosmetic companies or marketers must provide comprehensive information to satisfy customers’ browsing actions. Finally, besides the information related to the limited cosmetics product stock, discount and promotion as the effective strategy to stimulate the impulsive buying, the cosmetics marketing can use gamification, increasing the picture quality and equipping product descriptions, and making educational content. Social implications: The existence of {TikTok} Shop is increasing the number of cosmetics products and competitors because of product’s excessive availability in the market. In the social benefit context, the Generation Z Muslim women can purchase and use various cosmetics product available on {TikTok} Shop, but customers must be on guard by knowing the cosmetics material to prevent the healthiness. In addition, the existence of {TikTok} Shop and the impulsive purchases by the Generation Z Muslim women are also increasing the retailer or local cosmetics producer income. Originality/value: This study is a contribution to consumer behaviour literature by raising the Stimulus–Organism–Response framework used in determining the factors influencing browsing and impulsive consumption of cosmetic products on {TikTok} Shop. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We assess whether the increasing visibility of French hijabi fashion bloggers like these is changing attitudes about the integration of Muslims in France. The media construction of French Muslim identity and its resulting Islamophobia have created an ‘imaginary Islam’ steeped in negativism and racialised stigma, according to some scholars, to which our surveyed influencers respond, manipulating Orientalist tropes to foster ambiguities about religion, sexuality, and race. In drawing attention to dynamic, consumption-based intersections of modest fashion marketing, ‘erasure,’ and processes of meaning-making, we argue that hijabi French Muslim fashion bloggers are increasingly positioning themselves as ‘cyberarbiters’ of social transformation and shifting attitudes about the intersections of Islam, the body, and female sexuality. © 2021 Westburn Publishers Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 29 hijab-wearing women in Turkey. The authors collected data in June–November 2020. Findings: Findings show that hijab fashion functions as encouragement, attraction, modesty and social image among Turkish Muslim women. This study also shows that social media and influencers change the meaning of the hijab while promoting hijab fashion. Findings reveal that Instagram boutiques act as digital fashion magazines, which enable women to integrate faster into popular culture today. While influencers have increased the number of hijab-wearing women, they have also turned the hijab into a commodity in the market by degenerating its true meaning. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations regarding the sample and geographic context of consumers. This study may not represent Turkish Muslim women’s behavior as our sample consists of 29 women. Therefore, larger samples are needed to generalize our findings. Undertaking cross-cultural studies will also enable marketers to make cultural comparisons. Practical implications: This study offers some insights for Islamic marketing practitioners in terms of influencer using in hijab fashion. Originality/value: This study adds to the previous research on hijab fashion and hijab consumption on Instagram. This study also extends the previous literature by examining the role of social media and influencers in hijab fashion.

As an influencer, she markets this image of the "modern Muslim woman"to her followers on Instagram, showing them that they too can have a similar life if they consume particular products and perform certain actions. I argue that Cummings has expanded the definition of the "modern Muslim woman"to include a commitment to racial justice, following the Prophetic model of supporting marginalized community. Rather than dismantling the "modern Muslim woman"image, which traditionally excludes Black women, she expands the image to center Black women and Black issues. © 2022 Koninklijke Brill {NV}, Leiden.},

Still, there is a dearth of research on the subjective importance of Black American women’s social media use and risks for social media addiction. This study tested the association between social media use integration and social media addiction, and whether connectedness to Black women moderated this relationship. Data from 354 Black American women (Mage = 24.34 years) were collected using an online survey. We found that social media use integration was positively associated with social media addiction. Connectedness to Black women moderated this relation, such that the positive association between social media use integration and social media addiction was magnified at a higher level of connectedness to Black women.

Nonetheless, the prevalence of online misogyny is worsening across virtual contexts. This study employs online interviews with Nigerian women on Facebook to examine the manifestations, effects, and strategies for navigating online misogyny. Findings reveal that feminism, a budding feature of the Nigerian social media is fast becoming a central motivating factor for online misogyny. Consequently, women’s increasing online engagements are sparking incidents of misogyny that consciously serve to limit their online voices and visibility. Women’s experiences of online misogyny are interrogated as iterative of mainstream patriarchal ideology while muted group theory portraying women’s positioning as a traditionally muted group in mainstream society is deployed to unpack the constructions of misogyny and silencing. Findings challenge common portrayals of social media as gender-neutral environments. Misogynists attack women who adopt feminist tags and those considered pushovers. In response, women adopt a two-tier strategy: “moral persuasion” or “going hard” to deal with online abuse. This approach constitutes serious emotional labour on the part of women and despite its utility, remains unsustainable in fighting online misogyny. © 2022 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Particularly salient on social media is the lack of rules, etiquette or social taboos around racism controlling what people post and how they express themselves. This allows comments that are blatantly racist and antagonistic rather than concealed and subtle as is more socially acceptable in offline spaces. Using critical discourse analysis, the article will delve into the rhetorical and linguistic strategies the posters use to deny that racism toward Muslims can exist. It will expose how the denial of anti-Muslim racism is used in attempts to silence Muslims and anti-racists as well as to convince the general public that Muslims deserve the ill treatment they receive. However, exposing the strategies of racism deniers gives us a better understanding of how to resist such discourses. © 2022 by the author.},

Based on the results of three searches, 386 studies were retrieved and coded. Comparisons were made across all {LGB} individuals (138 studies), between {LGB} and heterosexual individuals (65 studies), and between {LGB} females and males (53 studies), with over 500,000 participants. Multiple types of victimization were coded, including discrimination, physical assault, and school victimization. Findings revealed that for {LGB} individuals, reports of victimization experiences were substantial (e.g., 55\% experienced verbal harassment, and 41\% experienced discrimination) and some types have increased since a 1992 review, while others have decreased. {LGB} individuals experienced greater rates of victimization than heterosexual individuals (range: d=.04-.58). {LGB} males experienced some types of victimization more than {LGB} females (e.g., weapon assault and being robbed) but, overall, the gender differences were small. It can be concluded that {LGB} individuals still experience a substantial amount of victimization. Implications for research methods are discussed, including recommendations for sampling and measurement of victimization. [Supplementary materials are available for this article.

First, we find that online harassment against journalists follows a systematic process that starts from the top, is followed through by a network of social media personalities and an army of trolls, and then completed by ordinary social media users. Second, cases of harassment impact journalists across multiple levels: individually, interpersonally and professionally. Finally, the participants referred to different ways of coping with what they experienced and identified three sources of support: their peers, their organizations and the public. Harassment against journalists has always been gendered, with women journalists finding themselves at the receiving end more often than do their male counterparts, and this has spilled over into digital platforms. © 2021 Informa {UK} Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Those stories did not only strike the silence that had long hid the perpetrators, but also allowed women to discharge some of their bottled-up grievances, and revealed many important information surrounding sexual harassment. In this paper, we present our analysis of about one million such tweets collected between October 15 and October 31, 2017 that reveals some interesting patterns and attributes of the people, place, emotions, actions, and reactions related to the tweeted stories. Based on our analysis, we also advance the discussion on the potential role of online social media in breaking the silence of women by factoring in the strengths and limitations of these platforms. © Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

However, body positive content is heterogeneous, and the processes underpinning the effects of body positive social media content on body image are not well understood. The aim of this study was to qualitatively examine variations in reactions to different types of body positive images among young people and their perceptions of the underlying processes. A sample of n=33 people, 67\% cisgender women, aged 14–25, mean ({SD}) = 19.6 (2.57) years, were interviewed. Thematic analysis revealed that body positive content highlighting the unrealistic nature of social media and inclusive in its broad portrayals of beauty were evaluated as most helpful. Two main processes were identified: (1) the broadening of understandings of beauty and greater inclusivity; and (2) the modeling of positive body image and active resistance to appearance ideals. However, these effects may vary according to content creators’ characteristics as well as individuals’ own body image concerns and their perceived proximity to those portrayed. Additional work across age, gender, and other identities is warranted to identify the most useful types of content for different individuals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, a series of meta-analyses were conducted on k = 30 studies (247 effect sizes) to examine risk factors for radicalization in youth, yielding significant effects for 15 out of 17 risk domains, ranging in magnitude from r = 0.080 to r = 0.482. Medium positive effects were found for activism, perceived in-group superiority and perceived distance to other people, while small effects were found for gender, personality, delinquency and aggression, lower educational level, negative peers, in-group identification, perceived discrimination, perceived group threat, perceived procedural injustice, perceived illegitimacy of authorities, and other, whereas the effect for poverty was very small. Moderator analyses showed that the risks of negative parenting and societal disconnection were smaller for right-wing radicalization than for religious or unspecified radicalization. The risks of personality and perceived group threat were greater for willingness to carry out extremist acts and extremist behavior than for attitude towards radicalization. Further, when the percentage of ethnic minorities in the sample increased, the risks of personality, negative parenting, and societal disconnection for radicalization were larger.},

	abstract = {Abstract There is a commonplace but powerful argument that links the religious resurgence in the Muslim world to the urban ecology of overcrowded slums in the large cities. Poverty and precarious life, together with anomie and lawlessness, condition the dispossessed to embrace ideologies and movements that offer communities of salvation and support while preaching radical politics. This article questions the premises of such arguments in an attempt to nuance the relationship between the urban dispossessed and radical Islam. By examining the politics of slums and militant Islamism in the Middle East, notably Egypt and Iran, I suggest that key to the habitus of the dispossessed is not anomie or extremism but ?informal life?? one that is characterized by flexibility, pragmatism, negotiation, as well as constant struggle for survival and self-development. The relationship between the urban dispossessed and radical Islamists tends to be both contingent and instrumental. Résumé On rencontre communément une thèse convaincante qui relie le renouveau religieux du monde musulman à l'écologie urbaine des quartiers pauvres et surpeuplés des grandes villes. Pauvreté et précarité, associées à anomie et non-droit, poussent les déshérités à rallier des idéologies ou mouvements qui proposent des communautés de salut et de soutien tout en prêchant des politiques radicales. Cet article revient sur les postulats utilisés et tente de nuancer le lien entre exclus urbains et Islam radical. En étudiant les politiques des quartiers pauvres et l'islamisme militant au Moyen-Orient, notamment en Egypte et Iran, il suggère que la clé de l'habitus des déshérités ne tient ni à l'anomie ni à l'extrémisme mais à une existence ?hors cadres?? dominée par la flexibilité, le pragmatisme et la négociation, autant que par une lutte permanente pour la survie et le développement personnel. Finalement, la relation entre exclus urbains et islamistes radicaux paraît à la fois plutôt contingente et instrumentale.},

	doi = {10.5334/irsp.573},
	abstract = {The present research aimed to extend the existing literature on political extremes’ symmetries and asymmetries, by examining the relationship between political extremism and perceived societal anomie (i.e., perceptions that the leadership is disregulated and that the social fabric is disintegrated) across three studies conducted within French samples. The first two studies revealed that perceived leadership disregulation increased as participants position themselves toward either political extreme and was associated with greater support for proposals regarding protectionism and economic redistribution; indicating a symmetry between political extremes. However, perceived social fabric disintegration was not associated with political extremism but was stronger for far-right individuals; thus suggesting an asymmetry between the extremes. The last study, conducted before the 2017 French Presidential elections, showed that, when imagining a future society in which the candidate they supported is elected as President, political extremes, compared to moderates, similarly reported reduced levels of leadership disregulation, but not social fabric disintegration. The present findings therefore suggest both similarities and differences between political extremes’ perception of anomie within current and future French society and extend previous work showing that political extremes share negative views of society.},

The purpose of this article is to offer such an integration. We feature a motivational construct, the quest for significance, defined as the need to have social worth. This need is typically fulfilled by a sense of measuring up to the values one shares with significant others. Our significance-quest theory ({SQT}) assumes that the need for significance is universal, whereas the means of satisfying it depend on the sociocultural context in which one?s values are embedded. Those means are identified in a narrative supported and validated by one?s network, or reference group. The quest for significance is activated by significance loss and/or the opportunity for significance gain. It motivates behavior that aims to affirm, realize, and/or show commitment to an important value. The {SQT} is consistent with large bodies of prior research and supported by novel studies in multiple laboratory and field settings. It transcends prior understandings and offers guidance for further study of this essential human motivation.},

We test a number of theories about how the unique combination of affordances on {TikTok} shapes how it is used for political communication. Compared to the dominant platform for political videos ({YouTube}) we find that a higher percentage of {TikTok} users upload videos, {TikTok} view counts are more dominated by virality, and viewership of videos are less dependent on a given accounts’ number of followers/subscribers. We discuss how these findings affect the production of content that ultimately determines the experience of {TikTok} consumers.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

We rely on recent literature comparing public opposition towards Muslims in general and opposition to Muslims’ religious practices, such as the wearing of the hijab. Based on a cross-nationally harmonized field experiment on hiring discrimination, we use two different signals of Muslimness (volunteering activities in a Muslim community centre or wearing the Muslim headscarf) to identify whether employers discriminate against Muslims as a group or against Muslims adhering to specific Muslim practices—in this case, wearing the headscarf. We present robust evidence that veiled Muslim women are discriminated against in Germany and the Netherlands, but only when applying for jobs that require a high level of customer contact. In Spain, however, the level of discrimination against veiled Muslim women is much smaller than in the other two countries. The high level of discrimination we found in the Netherlands, where the institutional context has traditionally been open to the accommodation of religious minority rights, is particularly surprising and points to the possibly stigmatizing effect of recent policies geared towards the cultural assimilation of immigrants.},

This article draws on three waves of research exploring the experiences of individuals currently or formerly involved in fringe communities, including the different stages of investment they progressed through, and ultimately, what made people leave. We propose a pathway model for understanding contemporary online radicalisation, including potential interventions that could be safely made at each stage. Insight into the experience of being immersed in these communities is essential for engaging with these people empathetically, and therefore preventing both the emergence of violent terrorists and protecting vulnerable people from being drawn into these communities.},

One key factor that may promote radicalization is social exclusion, the state of being kept apart from others. Indeed, experimental studies have provided initial evidence for a relation between exclusion and radicalism. The current review outlines and builds upon these research programs, arguing that social exclusion has been shown (a) to increase the willingness to fight-and-die, (b) to promote the approval for extreme, even violent, political parties and actions, and (c) to push the willingness to engage in illegal and violent action for a political cause.

	doi = {10.1016/j.eurpsy.2018.03.001},
	abstract = {Background: A new model of radicalisation has appeared in Western countries since the 2010s. Radical groups are smaller, less hierarchical and are mainly composed of young, homegrown individuals. The aim of this review is to decipher the profiles of the European adolescents and young adults who have embraced the cause of radical Islamism and to define the role of psychiatry in dealing with this issue. Methods: We performed a systematic search in several databases from January 2010 to July 2017 and reviewed the relevant studies that included European adolescents and/or young adults and presented empirical data. Results: In total, 22 qualitative and quantitative studies were reviewed from various fields and using different methodologies. Psychotic disorders are rare among radicalised youths. However, they show numerous risk factors common with adolescent psychopathologies. We develop a comprehensive three-level model to explain the phenomenon of radicalisation among young Europeans: (1) individual risk factors include psychological vulnerabilities such as early experiences of abandonment, perceived injustice and personal uncertainty; (2) micro-environmental risk factors include family dysfunction and friendships with radicalised individuals; (3) societal risk factors include geopolitical events and societal changes such as Durkheim's concept of anomie. Some systemic factors are also implicated as there is a specific encounter between recruiters and the individual. The former use sectarian techniques to isolate and dehumanise the latter and to offer him a new societal model. Conclusion: There are many similarities between psychopathological manifestations of adolescence and mechanisms at stake during the radicalisation process. As a consequence, and despite the rarity of psychotic disorders, mental health professionals have a role to play in the treatment and understanding of radical engagement among European youth. Studies with empirical data are limited, and more research should be promoted (in particular in females and in non-Muslim communities) to better understand the phenomenon and to propose recommendations for prevention and treatment.

	abstract = {The phenomena of closed and open mindedness are at the heart of the interface between cognitive and social processes. Every intelligible judgment, decision, or action rests on a subjective knowledge base held with at least a minimal degree of confidence. Formation of such knowledge requires that we shut off our minds to further relevant information that we could always strive and often manage to acquire. The relation of closed mindedness processes and social cognition and behavior is twofold. First, other people or groups of people often are the targets of our judgments, impressions, or stereotypes. Second, they are often our sources of information, and their opinions, judgments, and attitudes exert an important influence on our own. Thus, closed mindedness phenomena impact on what we think of others as well as how we think, in terms of the sources of information we take into account when forming our own opinions. The present volume highlights the motivational aspect of closed and open mindedness, discusses its antecedents and its consequences, and reports a body of empirical research exploring closed mindedness phenomena in a variety of domains.

And how does the transformation of territorial boundaries affect the scope and content of political conflicts?

While the mobilization of the losers of the processes of globalization by new right populist parties is seen to be the driving force of the restructuring of West European politics, the book goes beyond party politics. It attempts to show how the cleavage coalitions that are shaping up under the impact of globalization extend to state actors, interest groups and social movement organizations, and how the new conflicts are framed by the various actors involved. © Hanspeter Kriesi, Edgar Grande, Martin Dolezal, Marc Helbling, Dominic Höglinger, Swen Hutter and Bruno Wüest 2012.},

	abstract = {The article examines a number of ways in which the use of artificial intelligence technologies to predict the performance of individuals and to reach decisions concerning the entitlement of individuals to positive decisions impacts individuals and society. It analyses the effects using a social justice lens. Particular attention is paid to the experiences of individuals who have historically experienced disadvantage and discrimination. The article uses the university admissions process where the university utilises a fully automated decision-making process to evaluate the capability or suitability of the candidate as a case study. The article posits that the artificial intelligence decision-making process should be viewed as an institution that reconfigures the relationships between individuals, and between individuals and institutions. Artificial intelligence decision-making processes have institutional elements embedded within them that result in their operation disadvantaging groups who have historically experienced discrimination. Depending on the manner in which an artificial intelligence decision-making process is designed, it can produce solidarity or segregation between groups in society. There is a potential for the operation of artificial intelligence decision-making processes to fail to reflect the lived experiences of individuals and as a result to undermine the protection of human diversity. Some of these effects are linked to the creation of an ableist culture and to the resurrection of eugenics-type discourses. It is concluded that one of the contexts in which human beings should reach decisions is where the decision involves representing and evaluating the capabilities of an individual. The legislature should respond accordingly by identifying contexts in which it is mandatory to employ human decision-makers and by enacting the relevant legislation.},

Our findings show that 21 analysed documents look both at individual and societal impacts, with their understanding generally aligned in calls for more responsibility, accountability, transparency, safety or trust. Furthermore, our findings also point to the necessity of more integrated approaches between governments, industry and academia stakeholders, and above all, to the need of applied multidisciplinary frameworks, supported by both anticipatory outlooks and public engagement exercises able to tackle the often excessive technicality of the debate.},

In particular, this piece focuses on the ways in which Reddit?s karma point system, aggregation of material across subreddits, ease of subreddit and user account creation, governance structure, and policies around offensive content serve to provide fertile ground for anti-feminist and misogynistic activism. The ways in which these events and communities reflect certain problematic aspects of geek masculinity are also considered.

	abstract = {The dramatic increase in social media use has challenged traditional social structures and shifted a great deal of interpersonal communication from the physical world to cyberspace. Much of this social media communication has been positive: Anyone around the world who has access to the Internet has the potential to communicate with and attract a massive global audience. Unfortunately, such ubiquitous communication can be also used for negative purposes such as cyberbullying, which is the focus of this paper. Previous research on cyberbullying, consisting of 135 articles, has improved the understanding of why individuals?mostly adolescents?engage in cyberbullying. However, our study addresses two key gaps in this literature: (1) how the information technology ({IT}) artifact fosters/inhibits cyberbullying and (2) why people are socialized to engage in cyberbullying. To address these gaps, we propose the social media cyberbullying model ({SMCBM}), which modifies Akers? [Akers {RL} (2011) Social Learning and Social Structure: A General Theory of Crime and Deviance, 2nd ed. (Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, {NJ})] social structure and social learning model. Because Akers developed his model for crimes in the physical world, we add a rich conceptualization of anonymity composed of five subconstructs as a key social media structural variable in the {SMCBM} to account for the {IT} artifact. We tested the {SMCBM} with 1,003 adults who have engaged in cyberbullying. The empirical findings support the {SMCBM}. Heavy social media use combined with anonymity facilitates the social learning process of cyberbullying in social media in a way that fosters cyberbullying. Our results indicate new directions for cyberbullying research and implications for anticyberbullying practices.},

	abstract = {The Internet boosts immeasurably our collective capacity to archive information, search through large quantities of it quickly, and retrieve it rapidly. It is said that the Internet will expand access to education, good jobs, and better health and that it will create new deliberative spaces for political discussion and provide citizens with direct access to government. Insofar as such claims are plausible, Internet access is an important resource, and inequality in Internet access is a significant concern for social scientists who study inequality. This chapter reviews what we know about inequality in access to and use of new digital technologies. Until recently most research has focused on inequality in access (the "digital divide"), measured in a variety of ways. We agree that inequality of access is important, because it is likely to reinforce inequality in opportunities for economic mobility and social participation. At the same time we argue that a more thorough understanding of digital inequality requires placing Internet access in a broader theoretical context and asking a wider range of questions about the impact of information technologies and informational goods on social inequality. This chapter is structured around five key issues: 1. The digital divide. Who has access to the Internet, who does not have access, and how has access changed? This is the topic about which information is currently most abundant. 2. Is access to and use of the Internet more or less unequal than access to and use of other forms of information technology? Even if access to and use of the Internet is profoundly unequal, the Internet's spread may represent a net increase in equality over the pre-Web media landscape. The implications of the new digital technologies for inequality in access to information can be understood only in the context of a comparative analysis of the impact of inequality on access to and use of all the major communication media-not just the Internet but broadcast media, newspapers and magazines, telephones, and even word of mouth. If publishers stopped printing newspapers and put all the news online, would inequality in information about politics and world affairs diminish, become greater, or stay the same? 3. Among the increasing number of Internet users, how do such factors as gender, race, and socioeconomic status shape inequality in ease, effectiveness, and quality of use? What mechanisms account for links between individual attributes and technological outcomes? We place great importance on understanding socially structured variation in the ability of persons with formal access to the Internet to use it to enhance their access to valuable information resources. In particular, we are interested in the impact of social inequality on where, how easily, and with how much autonomy people can go online; the quality of the hardware and connection that users have at their disposal; how skilled users are at finding information; how effectively they can draw on social support in solving problems that they encounter in their efforts to do so; and how productively they use their Internet access to enhance their economic life chances and capacity for social and political participation. 4. Does access to and use of the Internet affect people's life chances? From the standpoint of public policy, the digital divide is only a problem insofar as going online shapes Internet users' life chances and capacity for civic engagement. What do we know about the effects of Internet access and use on such things as educational achievement and attainment, labor force participation, earnings, and voting? To what extent, if at all, do returns vary for different types of users? If there are no effects, or if the benefits for use are restricted to the already advantaged, then the case for government intervention to reduce inequality in access to digital technologies is correspondingly weaker.1 5. How might the changing technology, regulatory environment, and industrial organization of the Internet render obsolete the findings reported here? Because the Internet is a relatively new technology-browsers have been available for only about a decade and the Web was not fully privatized until the mid-1990s-we cannot assume that the results of research undertaken in past years will be replicated even a few years hence. The Internet is a moving target, with many economic and political interests vying to control its ultimate configuration. How might institutional changes-in economic control, in the codes that drive the technology, or in government regulatory and legislative actions-alter observed patterns of inequality in access and use? We begin with a brief account of the origins and spread of Internet technology. Next, in order to place this chapter in a broader perspective, we review earlier attempts to address the relationship between technological change and social inequality. Finally, we review the literature on each of the five main questions and, where the research is lacking, develop an agenda for the work that needs to be done.2.},

Using  survey data from a national sample of U.S. participants (N = 2,925) that we  collected during the early months of the pandemic, we analyzed how  sociodemographics, living arrangements, and Internet experiences and skills  relate to increases and decreases in various digital communication methods. We  find that people privileged in their socioeconomic status, their Internet skills  and online experiences are more likely to increase and less likely to decrease  digital communication during the pandemic. The findings illustrate how digital  inequalities can put already disadvantaged groups at greater risk of diminished  social contact during a public health crisis. We discuss the theoretical  implications of our findings for digital inequality research, the practical  implications for inclusive crisis responses, and directions for future research.},

Current research tends to focus on the Internet's implications in five domains: 1) inequality (the "digital divide"); 2) community and social capital; 3) political participation; 4) organizations and other economic institutions; and 5) cultural participation and cultural diversity. A recurrent theme across domains is that the Internet tends to complement rather than displace existing media and patterns of behavior. Thus in each domain, utopian claims and dystopic warnings based on extrapolations from technical possibilities have given way to more nuanced and circumscribed understandings of how Internet use adapts to existing patterns, permits certain innovations, and reinforces particular kinds of change. Moreover, in each domain the ultimate social implications of this new technology depend on economic, legal, and policy decisions that are shaping the Internet as it becomes institutionalized. Sociologists need to study the Internet more actively and, particularly, to synthesize research findings on individual user behavior with macroscopic analyses of institutional and political-economic factors that constrain that behavior.]},

I use the results of a large qualitative study of transnational families, conducted in Australia, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Iran, Singapore and New Zealand, to examine how and whether kin maintain contact across time and space. The research demonstrates that {ICTs} are more available for some people than for others. However, also and possibly more important in the decisions people make about using particular communication technologies are the social and cultural contexts of family life, which render some {ICTs} more desirable than others at specific points in time. Acknowledging this provides an important corrective to economic analyses of transnationalism, and contributes to theorizing and documenting the role of {ICTs} in the maintenance of transnational social networks.},

Low-cost calls serve as a kind of social glue connecting small-scale social formations across the globe. In this article I present recent data on the rapid growth and diffusion of telephone traffic and describe the proliferation of prepaid phonecards. Second, I outline the commercial, social and geographical ramifications of this explosion in transnational communication.},

The paper also presents as a case study, a sentiment analysis, and term-linkage network for one perpetrator?s total 3,000 tweets. Several themes were found in the data?there were shooters who changed their posting habits and in some cases, stopped using social media entirely in the lead up to their crime; shooters who used hate speech and were ?radicalized? to violence online; shooters with a demonstrable interest in violence, who referenced past mass shooters in their own communications; shooters who exhibited signs of mental illness and suicidality; shooters who were already known to authorities; and shooters who like those described above, actively posted while shooting, presumably to boost their own celebrity status. The findings from this study provide insight into commonalities among mass shooters in terms of their social media usage, which could lead to new pathways for prevention and intervention.},

Recently a "contagion" effect  has been suggested wherein the occurrence of one mass shooting increases the  likelihood of another mass shooting occurring in the near future. Although  contagion is a convenient metaphor used to describe the temporal spread of a  behavior, it does not explain how the behavior spreads. Generalized imitation is  proposed as a better model to explain how one person's behavior can influence  another person to engage in similar behavior. Here we provide an overview of  generalized imitation and discuss how the way in which the media report a mass  shooting can increase the likelihood of another shooting event. Also, we propose  media reporting guidelines to minimize imitation and further decrease the  likelihood of a mass shooting.},

Initial empirical studies of that deconstruct those concepts. The paper gives an overview of these attempts, including several undertaken by the author. It shows that the organizational development of Islam in Germany and the intergenerational change of its clientele have little correspondence with the conditions for inclusion established by the discourse of the German majority. At the same time, the discourse itself proves to be complex and more determined by conflicting interests between various groups within the Muslim and German communities than simply a Muslim–German divide.},

This paper presents a novel methodological framework for studying mobilization strategies of far-right groups on {TikTok}, employing a mixed-method approach that combines manual annotation, unsupervised image classification, and named-entity recognition to analyze the dynamics of radical visuals at scale. Differentiating between internal and external mobilization, we use popularity and engagement cues to investigate far-right mobilization efforts on {TikTok} within and outside their community. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness of unsupervised image classification when utilized within a broader mixed-method framework, as each observed far-right group employs unique platform characteristics. While Conspiracists flourish in terms of overall popularity and internal mobilization, nationalist and protest content succeeds by using a variety of persuasive visual content to attract and engage external audiences. The study contributes to existing literature by bridging the gap between visual political communication at scale and radicalization research. By offering insights into mobilization strategies of far-right groups, our study provides a foundation for policymakers, researchers, and online platforms to develop proactive measures to address the risks associated with the dissemination of extremist ideologies on social media.\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;/div\&gt;},

Interviewees discussed two vignettes (one familiar, the other relatively unfamiliar) in each of three different content domains (religious, ethical and environmental). Attempts were also made to increase individuals' integrative complexity of thought about each dilemma by means of several "prodding" questions. Across domains, complexity of thought was significantly higher for familiar than for unfamiliar vignettes. Also, we were successful in increasing respondents' complexity levels with our graduated prompts. Dispositional measures (religious fundamentalism, Christian orthodoxy, right-wing authoritarianism, dogmatism, and need for cognition) were related to complexity of thought, but these associations were not consistent across domains. In particular, we concluded that religious fundamentalism and orthodoxy were negatively related to complexity of thought for existential issues only, and a reconsideration of previous investigations suggested that this is in fact a consistent tendency in related research.]},

The proposal is straightforward-extreme subjective uncertainty, particularly relating to self-conception, motivates people to define themselves, via self-categorization and social identification processes, in terms of the highly consensual, distinctive, and clearly focused prototypes of high entitativity groups. This analysis is framed by the social identity perspective, and develops the uncertainty reduction theory of social identity motivation to incorporate notions of entitativity. The chapter opens by examining the general question of what is the relationship between uncertainty, identity, and totalism. The author then briefly review key aspects of the social identity perspective and outline in detail the uncertainty reduction hypothesis. The author extends the analysis with a conceptual discussion of prototypicality and entitativity and describe some relevant studies. The chapter closes with some concluding comments.

	abstract = {While I write this chapter, millions of people in the Darfur province of Sudan have been terrorized off their land; the entire population of Iraq has little idea what the future of their country will be; survivors of hurricane Katrina are dispersed across the United States; people in Britain are anxious about immigration and are toying with the idea of supporting the British National Party; people in a small town in Tasmania wait to hear if members of their community have been found alive in a mine collapse; air travelers the world over have no idea what new security arrangements await them when they get to the airport; and we all wonder about the consequences of further escalation in the price of oil and of the standoff over Iran's uranium enrichment program. The world is an uncertain place, it always has been, and these uncertainties can make it very difficult to predict or plan our lives and to feel sure about the type of people we are. In this chapter, I describe how feelings of uncertainty, particularly about or related to self, motivate people to identify with social groups and to choose new groups with, or configure existing groups to have, certain properties that best reduce, control, or protect from feelings of uncertainty. I consider this uncertainty–identity theory to be a development of the motivational component of social identity theory. It addresses why, when, and how strongly people identify with groups, and why groups may have particular generic properties in certain contexts. Of particular relevance to contemporary postmodern society, uncertainty reduction theory provides an account of zealotry and the cult of the “true believer” in the thrall of ideology and powerful leadership—an account of conditions that may spawn extremism, a silo mentality, and a loss of moral or ethical perspective. In this chapter, I describe uncertainty–identity theory and some conceptual elaborations and applications, review direct and indirect empirical tests, and locate the theory in the context of related ideas and theories in social psychology. I start with a historical sketch of why, when, and how uncertainty–identity theory was developed, then go on to discuss uncertainty reduction as a motivation for human behavior. I then detail the process by which group identification reduces uncertainty and describe a program of studies showing that people who feel uncertain are more likely to identify and identify more strongly with groups. High‐entitativity groups are best equipped to reduce uncertainty through identification—entitativity moderates the uncertainty–identification relation. I discuss this idea and describe research that supports it, and then extend the analysis to deal with extremism and totalistic groups—describing how extreme uncertainty may encourage strong identification (zealotry, fanaticism, being a true believer) with groups that are structured in a totalistic fashion. Again I describe some research supporting this idea. The next section deals with extensions, applications, and implications of uncertainty–identity theory. I discuss the relation between depersonalization and self‐projection processes in uncertainty‐motivated group identification, and then, in a subsection entitled central members, marginal members, leaders, and deviants, I focus on the role of group prototypicality in uncertainty reduction processes. The role of trust, the relation between uncertainty, identity, and ideology, and the role of uncertainty in social mobilization are also discussed. The final section, before concluding comments, discusses other theories, approaches, and topics that deal with constructs related to those discussed by uncertainty–identity theory. Specifically, I discuss uncertainty as a state versus a trait, with a focus on the constructs of need for cognitive closure and uncertainty orientation; the role played by culture in uncertainty; and the relevance of terror management, compensatory conviction, self‐verification, and system justification.},

	abstract = {Abstract Scholars in a number of disciplines have sought to assess the power of reading or viewing a personal story to modify people's beliefs. However, the research, which has been pursued under diverse programs, has produced conflicting findings. We focus on the persuasiveness of personal stories about problems that are structural (rather than individual) and whose solution requires government action. Overall, the research suggests that although personal stories can overcome people's tendency to resist new information, they often do not do so. People's preexisting beliefs, assumptions, and stereotypes affect their willingness to be absorbed by a story, to empathize with the stories' protagonists, and to endorse the message communicated by the story. We argue also for a sociological perspective on narrative persuasion, one which, unlike the mostly experimental research conducted so far, pays attention to the context in which people encounter stories and to the norms shaping people's assessment of a story as credible, relevant, and important.},

	abstract = {In this experiment, we examine effects of television dramas on support for controversial public policies (gay marriage and the death penalty) and explore mechanisms that may explain such effects. The dramas influenced support for death penalty but not gay marriage. As predicted, exposure to the relevant drama eliminated the relationship between prior ideology (conceptualized as a continuous variable) and death penalty support. Moreover, the valence of the relationship between prior (increasingly liberal) ideology and salience of a relevant value (perceived importance of a safe and crime-free society) went from negative in the comparison condition to positive after exposure to the relevant drama. These and other results suggest that a television narrative can influence policy support by reframing the dramatic situation to reduce the effect of prior ideology and values and by minimizing processing of the story as intentionally persuasive discourse.},

Given the two growing phenomena of “online radicalization” and “behavioral/ideological/organizational de-radicalization,” this article outlines a broad strategy for countering the narratives of violent extremists. It argues that an effective counter-narrative should be built on three pillars. The first is an effective comprehensive message that dismantles and counter-argues against every dimension of the extremist narrative, namely the theological, political, historical, instrumental and socio-psychological dimensions. The second pillar is the messengers. The article argues that for the first time in the history of Jihadism a “critical mass” of former militants, who rebelled not only against the current behaviour of their former colleagues but also against the ideology supporting it, has come into existence. This “critical mass” can constitute the core of credible messengers, especially the few de-radicalized individuals and groups that still maintain influence and respect among vulnerable communities. The third pillar is the dissemination and attraction strategy of the counter-narratives(s) which focuses on the role of the media. The author of the article outlines a broad framework, which is a part of a {UN}-sponsored, comprehensive research project on countering the extremists narrative.]},

We then present results from an interview study with {TikTok} creators on their motivations to utilize algospeak. Our results indicate that algospeak is used to oppose {TikTok}’s algorithmic moderation system in order to prevent unjust content violations and shadowbanning when posting about benign yet seemingly unwanted subjects on {TikTok}. In this, we find that although algospeak helps to prevent consequences, it often impedes the creation of quality content.

We interviewed 19 {TikTok} creators about their motivations and practices of using algospeak in relation to their experience with {TikTok}?s content moderation. Participants largely anticipated how {TikTok}?s algorithm would read their videos, and used algospeak to evade unjustified content moderation while simultaneously ensuring target audiences can still find their videos. We identify non-contextuality, randomness, inaccuracy, and bias against marginalized communities as major issues regarding freedom of expression, equality of subjects, and support for communities of interest.
